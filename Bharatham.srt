00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:48,941
Hey, kutta

3
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,273
Hey, Kunjunni

4
00:07:50,373 --> 00:07:51,546
Hey!

5
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:52,646
You'll fall on face

6
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,760
Instead of nodding off like this, why don't you clear the bed and sleep on it?

7
00:07:56,106 --> 00:07:57,106
Hasn't the Sir come yet?

8
00:07:57,206 --> 00:07:58,206
If he had come, wouldn't you see him?

9
00:07:58,442 --> 00:07:59,442
It's past 12 ...

10
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:01,538
This is really not done.

11
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,130
Just wait for him to get here.

12
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:04,946
This has been going on for a while

13
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:07,957
I will end this practice from today onwards
What, the concert?

14
00:08:08,057 --> 00:08:10,258
No, the side business after the concert!

15
00:08:10,898 --> 00:08:13,735
The more I let it go, the worse it becomes.

16
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,451
There's no point in putting it so lightly

17
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:17,731
You need to be direct

18
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,831
I'll tell him!

19
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:19,931
What, you don't think he'd listen to me?

20
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:22,108
Regardless of his greatness as a singer

21
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:27,402
If my expression changes, he'll quake. That goes for both brothers.

22
00:08:28,249 --> 00:08:31,242
But if only your expression would change. Right?

23
00:08:33,007 --> 00:08:34,252
You weren't asleep?

24
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:38,006
Uncle, why can't you have a serious talk with him?

25
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:40,048
Well, in that case, can't you do the same?

26
00:08:40,342 --> 00:08:41,916
There are limits to what I can discuss with him.

27
00:08:42,016 --> 00:08:43,317
You can rebuke him

28
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:44,417
Can I do that?

29
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:47,089
I've thought about it several times. However,

30
00:08:47,189 --> 00:08:50,774
When I see that walk, laugh and demeanor, I cannot help but think of your father

31
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:52,867
I have not had the audacity to sit before him except during a concert

32
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,631
Everywhere he went, he had devotees

33
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:55,998
How many temptations

34
00:08:56,098 --> 00:08:57,503
And that too, at such important people's places.

35
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:58,603
And he has never failed.

36
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,583
Music was God to him

37
00:09:00,683 --> 00:09:01,863
When the son of a man like that...

38
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,506
God save us.

39
00:09:05,516 --> 00:09:09,025
Those are merely other people's beliefs.

40
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,824
Music is from the heart

41
00:09:10,924 --> 00:09:13,765
It doesn't disappear just because you had a few drinks.

42
00:09:14,163 --> 00:09:17,363
And if that's the case, these Western folk partake quite often and there's music.

43
00:09:17,675 --> 00:09:19,872
Therefore, there shouldn't be any music there!

44
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:22,813
Thus, that's not the truth.

45
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:27,155
Each group has its own practices and beliefs.

46
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:28,255
And that's the right way.

47
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:34,369
I've seen several great artists get sloshed
 before a performance.

48
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,151
You must remember one thing

49
00:09:36,251 --> 00:09:39,940
We are supposed to consume alcohol; it must not consume us

50
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,465
It doesn't matter which artists comes to me

51
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:45,026
I will show him a great time before he leaves.

52
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,569
Artists are the wealth of the country.

53
00:09:47,669 --> 00:09:49,143
We must respect them

54
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:50,243
Love them

55
00:09:50,343 --> 00:09:54,592
Now, look, the committee is not going to reimburse me for all this.

56
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:55,692
It'll go straight from my pocket!

57
00:09:55,792 --> 00:09:56,792
Let it go!

58
00:09:56,892 --> 00:09:58,277
It's for art!

59
00:09:58,377 --> 00:10:00,457
The satisfaction my soul gets is enough.

60
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:01,557
I'm done.

61
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:02,657
I think I overdid it a bit.

62
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:06,131
If three people share one bottle, it's bad luck to not finish it!

63
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,585
Let's finish this off.

64
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,366
Ah no, they're all waiting for me.
Let them wait!

65
00:10:09,466 --> 00:10:11,512
You only need to go once we have done this properly.

66
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,612
Ah sorry, that won't work out.

67
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,231
It's my younger brother and uncle.
Uncle?

68
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:17,549
Don't you know Pallavoor Parameshwaran Nair?

69
00:10:17,649 --> 00:10:19,764
He's the king of the mrithangam (drum).

70
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,355
His own uncle.

71
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,791
He's not only my uncle

72
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:25,594
He is my guru as well. He even taught the mrithangam to my father.

73
00:10:25,694 --> 00:10:27,756
Oho, so your father was in the same line of work as well.

74
00:10:27,856 --> 00:10:29,451
What country are you from!?

75
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,531
Haven't you heard of Payyannoor Devanarayana Namboodri?

76
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:34,157
Who is he?
Well ...

77
00:10:34,257 --> 00:10:37,098
To be honest, I haven't heard of him.

78
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:43,187
When I'm busy with my business I occasionally dabble in the arts.

79
00:10:43,287 --> 00:10:47,443
Hey. A talent like that has never been seen here.
Really?

80
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:50,263
Then, next year, his concert is enough for us. What do you think?

81
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:52,218
Then your dead father needs to figure it out!

82
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,211
He passed away around 15 years ago.

83
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,948
What a loss. An eternal loss.

84
00:10:59,691 --> 00:11:01,923
If I stay here any longer, we cannot part on good terms.

85
00:11:02,023 --> 00:11:04,622
Huh? What ...
That's how it is.

86
00:11:25,091 --> 00:11:26,091
You got tired of waiting, right?

87
00:11:28,274 --> 00:11:29,274
Gopi...

88
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:31,679
As they say, it just happened.

89
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,239
The committee folk asked me to come over to give me the rest of the money.

90
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:36,350
We were chatting for a while and I didn't realize how time had flown

91
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,889
Call everyone. Let's head out.

92
00:11:40,484 --> 00:11:41,695
Why are you looking at me like that?

93
00:11:41,795 --> 00:11:43,252
They entertained you really well, didn't they?

94
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:44,531
Entertainment?

95
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:50,341
They poured a bit of something with my juice.

96
00:11:50,441 --> 00:11:51,441
Just a bit.

97
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,878
I have to travel for a few hours, right?

98
00:11:53,978 --> 00:11:54,978
It relieves the fatigue.

99
00:11:55,078 --> 00:11:56,623
But, this is not good for us at all.

100
00:11:57,061 --> 00:11:58,897
Do you know how much sister-in-law worries?

101
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,531
Nobody in our family has this habit.

102
00:12:00,631 --> 00:12:02,350
Save the sermon for later.

103
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,450
Call the others; let's go.

104
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,550
There's no need to travel today.

105
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,650
They've all gone to bed.

106
00:12:07,082 --> 00:12:09,356
Everyone knows you've started this habit.

107
00:12:09,456 --> 00:12:11,680
But nobody needs to know that it has reached this state

108
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,780
Especially Uncle.

109
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:18,501
He doesn't merely treat you with the respect befitting just his relative, or daughter's husband. 

110
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:20,152
Please, don't worry him.

111
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:24,025
I don't drink excessively as you guys think.

112
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:25,125
I'm starting to understand that.

113
00:12:27,444 --> 00:12:29,415
In any case, we will only leave in the morning.

114
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,711
Aunty, you know the guy who just moved in next door?

115
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:47,811
A baldy?

116
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:49,558
He wants to know all kinds of things.

117
00:12:49,658 --> 00:12:50,658
Do you sing?

118
00:12:50,758 --> 00:12:51,758
Do you dance?

119
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,071
And then, what do people here know?

120
00:12:54,678 --> 00:12:56,631
I went to him with some milk and he had me there for an hour with his questions.

121
00:12:58,265 --> 00:13:00,016
Oh wow, that looks beautiful

122
00:13:00,116 --> 00:13:01,684
You should give it to me once it's done

123
00:13:01,784 --> 00:13:02,784
Appu!

124
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:04,833
Don't you have anything to read or study?

125
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,837
It took you an hour to deliver some milk

126
00:13:06,937 --> 00:13:08,858
Check out the loitering police

127
00:13:36,726 --> 00:13:40,437
Oh Radha. Have you already started with your stitching in the morning?

128
00:13:40,537 --> 00:13:41,537
Go to the kitchen.

129
00:13:41,637 --> 00:13:43,957
Can't you see your sister-in-law toiling away alone?

130
00:13:47,932 --> 00:13:51,081
Father, your hot water for the bath is ready.

131
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,490
Devu, haven't the kids returned?
No, they haven't.

132
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,797
They said they'd be back in the night.

133
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:58,458
Ramani has been up all night waiting for them.

134
00:14:02,298 --> 00:14:04,083
Where is that girl?

135
00:14:04,183 --> 00:14:06,862
I had sent her over here.
She must be next door or something.

136
00:14:07,334 --> 00:14:10,668
She's so lazy. All she wants to do is dress up and loll about.

137
00:14:10,768 --> 00:14:12,571
I told her it was OK.

138
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:17,355
If she comes in contact with the heat, or if she burns herself at the fire, that's enough for her brothers.

139
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:21,481
I won't hear the end of their complaints about making her work and exhaust herself.

140
00:14:21,581 --> 00:14:24,546
Women should be knowledgeable about these things.

141
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:28,571
When she joins a new household soon, will her brothers be around to help with the kitchen work?

142
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:32,445
I think they've arrived. Can you keep an eye on this?

143
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:38,346
Here you go.

144
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
Can you put this away?

145
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:44,049
Yes, sir

146
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,828
Did you get worried when we didn't turn up last night?

147
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:49,169
Oh no. It's not like you're all little kids.

148
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:51,358
Sure, sure. You probably haven't slept all night.

149
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,891
Don't I know her?

150
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:54,878
Father, why don't you come in for some tea?

151
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:55,978
I'll have tea at home.

152
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:57,977
Who knows what's happening there now!

153
00:14:58,077 --> 00:14:59,077
Let's go!

154
00:15:00,268 --> 00:15:05,489
It's hard to tell when these festival concerts start or end. Can't be sure of anything!

155
00:15:05,944 --> 00:15:08,824
Were you worried?
Oh, not at all. Mother and grandfather worried.

156
00:15:10,693 --> 00:15:14,230
There's no need to talk to Mother or Ramani about what happened yesterday.

157
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,099
If someone asks, there are reasons.

158
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,199
Basically, you want me to lie.

159
00:15:18,002 --> 00:15:19,990
Unpleasant truths don't need to be stated.

160
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,246
Unpleasant actions don't need to be committed.

161
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:24,604
That, I promise.

162
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:26,356
There have been several promises like this in the past.

163
00:15:26,456 --> 00:15:27,456
This is not like that!

164
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:29,404
This ... is for sure.

165
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:32,924
What are you guys whispering about outside instead of coming in?

166
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:36,512
The things which happened yesterday. The elephant went wild!

167
00:15:36,612 --> 00:15:37,893
Oh no! And then?

168
00:15:37,993 --> 00:15:41,227
And then... Nothing happened, but the concert started at 2pm.

169
00:15:41,327 --> 00:15:44,006
What, what happened?
Father, the elephant attacked!

170
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:47,038
And then?
And then ... oh, the things which happened, Grandfather.

171
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:48,149
Gopi, why don't you tell them?

172
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,413
And how am I supposed to tell them?

173
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:50,962
I need to bathe and eat something!

174
00:15:51,062 --> 00:15:52,158
What's there to eat, mother?

175
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:53,258
There's dosa (savory crepe).

176
00:15:53,358 --> 00:15:55,408
And was the elephant contained, Gopi?
The elephant ...

177
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:58,238
Grandfather, it's time I went to the office. I'll tell you once I get back.
What, what?

178
00:15:59,535 --> 00:16:00,730
I wonder which elephant it was ...

179
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,130
Mother ... mother ... MOTHER!

180
00:16:23,787 --> 00:16:24,787
What, what happened?

181
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:25,887
I called mother.

182
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:26,987
To tell her that I'm leaving

183
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,772
Do you really need to rend your throat screaming like a demoness?

184
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:33,707
You really scared me. I thought something terrible had happened.

185
00:16:33,807 --> 00:16:35,273
No, it's not that. I missed Gopiettan.

186
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:37,092
So what? Don't you know how to get there by yourself?

187
00:16:37,192 --> 00:16:38,192
Then, get going!

188
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,644
I didn't get any sleep last night and I had just managed to fall asleep. Now, that's gone.

189
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:46,018
I'm here for an audit.

190
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,214
I'm from Piravam.

191
00:16:47,314 --> 00:16:48,612
Sir, are you here with your family?

192
00:16:48,712 --> 00:16:49,712
No, I'm here alone.

193
00:16:49,812 --> 00:16:51,374
I have met your mother and grandfather.

194
00:16:51,474 --> 00:16:53,260
In any case, I'm quite lucky to have gotten that house.

195
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,898
Because I can tell people at home that I was Kalloor Ramanathan's neighbor for a while

196
00:16:56,998 --> 00:16:58,515
You shouldn't be this arrogant

197
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,317
Can't you turn around when someone's calling you?

198
00:17:00,417 --> 00:17:02,961
In any case, I get the hint. Nowadays you always ignore me.

199
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:04,061
She's my cousin.

200
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:05,161
Daughter of my uncle.

201
00:17:05,261 --> 00:17:07,138
Which means, she's your betrothed, right?

202
00:17:07,238 --> 00:17:08,238
That's right

203
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:09,338
I'll leave you to talk.

204
00:17:11,972 --> 00:17:13,269
Devi, you need to cultivate some manners.

205
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,919
Is it right to throw a tantrum when I'm speaking to someone?

206
00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:16,019
What would he think?

207
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,119
He can get lost.

208
00:17:23,677 --> 00:17:26,793
It looks really full. We can catch the next bus. Also, I want to talk to you about something.

209
00:17:26,893 --> 00:17:29,285
You can take the next bus. You can get to your college whenever you like.

210
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:33,967
If I'm not in my seat by 10, the superintendent will mark me as absent. That's the kind of ass he is.
Gopietta!

211
00:17:34,067 --> 00:17:35,067
Gopietta!

212
00:17:39,047 --> 00:17:40,047
Can you stop?

213
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,512
Ah, the artist has arrived!

214
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:03,137
Was there a concert yesterday?

215
00:18:03,237 --> 00:18:05,041
The superintendent has asked to see you.

216
00:18:05,141 --> 00:18:06,141
For what?

217
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,634
Must be to organize a concert!

218
00:18:21,085 --> 00:18:22,085
Sir?

219
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:24,190
Yes?

220
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,857
I was told to meet you?

221
00:18:25,957 --> 00:18:27,710
It's not because I have any desire to meet you.

222
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,175
What are you playing at?

223
00:18:29,444 --> 00:18:31,348
There was a concert by my brother yesterday.

224
00:18:31,448 --> 00:18:34,261
I don't run my office based on your brother's concerts!

225
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:36,670
An urgent file was requested by the RDO.

226
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:37,950
What excuse will I give?

227
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:41,554
You only care about concerts. Who do you think you are? Yesudas?

228
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,996
Sir, there's no need to get so worked up.

229
00:18:44,096 --> 00:18:45,394
I'll take half a day off.

230
00:18:45,494 --> 00:18:47,735
Leave? What if I don't grant the leave?

231
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,537
Sir, this isn't something that you need to grant.

232
00:18:49,637 --> 00:18:50,637
Usually, people take the leave.

233
00:18:50,737 --> 00:18:52,636
One of these days, I'll teach you a lesson.
That's it right?

234
00:18:52,736 --> 00:18:53,736
You're not going to kill me by hanging right?

235
00:18:53,836 --> 00:18:56,594
Let me see if I can start work without you granting me leave.

236
00:18:56,694 --> 00:18:59,794
You cannot meet the RDO regarding the office without my permission!

237
00:18:59,894 --> 00:19:00,894
Who's the RDO? God?

238
00:19:00,994 --> 00:19:01,994
Let me see if I can meet him.

239
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:10,286
God, huh?

240
00:19:11,347 --> 00:19:12,812
Let him come. I'll deal with him.

241
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:25,629
OK, OK, I'll ask him.

242
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,120
It's a complaint about you.

243
00:19:31,355 --> 00:19:32,355
The superintendent.

244
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:34,337
Why are you the office rebel?

245
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,037
Sir, I was half an hour late.

246
00:19:36,137 --> 00:19:38,749
He didn't allow me to put it down as leave either.
Ah, sit.

247
00:19:41,452 --> 00:19:44,860
I heard that you said something disrespectful about me ... ?

248
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,383
Sir, do you really think so?

249
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:48,736
Na, I just asked for the heck of it since he brought it up.

250
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:51,140
Isn't he aware that we knew each other before this job?

251
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,078
I haven't mentioned it to anyone, sir.

252
00:19:53,178 --> 00:19:56,036
I don't want people to think I'm taking advantage of our relationship

253
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:57,558
Don't you need to clock in?

254
00:19:58,043 --> 00:19:59,479
I'll take half the day off

255
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,797
As if you should use your vacation days to satisfy your stubbornness. 

256
00:20:04,565 --> 00:20:05,983
Connect me to the superintendent

257
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:10,187
He's here.

258
00:20:11,346 --> 00:20:12,765
Can you send the attendance register over?

259
00:20:14,408 --> 00:20:17,609
Man, all government offices have this kind of jealousy 

260
00:20:17,989 --> 00:20:20,048
Back in the village office

261
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:23,716
I distinctly remember him kicking me around because of a few plays I did

262
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:28,421
Once they put on the IAS crown, there's no respect for theater or music.

263
00:20:29,442 --> 00:20:30,653
I'm free till the afternoon

264
00:20:31,795 --> 00:20:33,282
Till then, you're going to work here

265
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,033
We can have some music and arts for a bit, what say?

266
00:20:37,538 --> 00:20:40,410
No vistors till the afternoon; I'm very busy.
OK, sir.

267
00:21:15,532 --> 00:21:16,532
Please stay

268
00:21:20,217 --> 00:21:22,223
Doing the <i>deepaaradhana</i> is comforting now

269
00:21:26,583 --> 00:21:28,988
What's your name?

270
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:34,039
Is there anything wrong in me knowing it?

271
00:21:37,849 --> 00:21:38,849
Ah it's Vijayan

272
00:21:38,949 --> 00:21:39,949
Come

273
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:41,253
Have a seat inside

274
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:45,180
No, can't sit down. I'm going home tomorrow since it's a second Saturday.

275
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,931
So I don't need milk tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Do tell your mother.
Will do.

276
00:21:48,031 --> 00:21:49,031
I'll take your leave. OK. 

277
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:57,584
Who's playing the veena?

278
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:59,349
That's my younger sister, Radha.

279
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:02,722
Does your sister sing as well?

280
00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:04,937
No, she is mute.

281
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:22,254
Sorry, I didn't know.
No, it's not a problem.

282
00:22:24,433 --> 00:22:26,112
I should go

283
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:52,667
Aha, you're sitting here quite safely

284
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:55,365
You took a lot of money off me in that game the day-before-yesterday

285
00:22:55,465 --> 00:22:57,701
Call sister-in-law; we'll play a turn.

286
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,818
Don't cheat OK? 
As if

287
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:09,690
Mother's game!

288
00:23:12,215 --> 00:23:14,326
Listen, hit it fully on the line

289
00:23:19,429 --> 00:23:22,561
Ammai, look go for the red!

290
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:28,616
Now she'll play by herself for half an hour. Let's kill time talking about something.

291
00:23:29,308 --> 00:23:30,830
Then, can I ask something?

292
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:34,515
Is the elephant story made-up or true?

293
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:37,283
Elephant story? Which elephant?

294
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:40,725
Oh, at the concert. That's not made up!

295
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:44,064
She broke rank. It could've been a big problem.

296
00:23:44,164 --> 00:23:46,192
Luckily it was a female elephant. She calmed down quickly.

297
00:23:46,711 --> 00:23:49,652
Play quickly!
Don't break my concentration; let me play!

298
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:51,538
Does a female elephant go wild?

299
00:23:53,095 --> 00:23:55,223
A female elephant doesn't go wild, does it?

300
00:23:55,323 --> 00:23:58,700
Actually, now I'm not sure if it were male or female

301
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,554
Do you really want to put on this show for me?

302
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:03,769
I've known you since you were born

303
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,038
I wanted to tell you

304
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:11,259
That brother has started some undesirable habits

305
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,581
I'll tell you later

306
00:24:15,775 --> 00:24:17,055
I know, Gopi

307
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:19,304
I've known for a while

308
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:23,041
In the beginning, I thought it was just medicine

309
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:24,736
Only later did I understand

310
00:24:25,895 --> 00:24:28,057
That he was adding something else to the medicine

311
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:30,531
I'm tired of talking about it

312
00:24:31,607 --> 00:24:32,607
Mother, it's your turn!

313
00:24:34,721 --> 00:24:35,721
What happened, mother?

314
00:24:35,821 --> 00:24:36,821
Nothing happened!

315
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:38,558
Red, where's the red coin?

316
00:24:38,658 --> 00:24:39,658
We knocked that in a while back!

317
00:24:39,758 --> 00:24:41,586
Then, what's the point of playing!?

318
00:24:41,686 --> 00:24:42,686
Hey, Father is coming!

319
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:48,990
It seems that everyone is playing all the time here

320
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,270
Tomorrow and day after are holidays

321
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,229
Oh, so you don't need to open your books at all for the next two days!

322
00:24:53,886 --> 00:24:56,343
Instead of wasting time playing, can't you do your vocal exercises?

323
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:57,969
I'll do it early in the morning tomorrow.

324
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:01,100
I don't need to go into work tomorrow since it's a holiday tomorrow.

325
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,986
I've seen so many holidays

326
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:08,106
Ever since he got this government job, I have never heard him sing apart from the concerts.

327
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,514
Sister-in-law, didn't I sing early in the morning for 2 hours?

328
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:17,500
Why are you needlessly making her lie?

329
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Appu!

330
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,133
Go call grandmother and grandfather

331
00:25:23,832 --> 00:25:26,392
Music is like a lamp

332
00:25:26,492 --> 00:25:29,558
If you polish it daily, it will shine like gold.

333
00:25:29,658 --> 00:25:30,658
If not

334
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:33,520
It will be covered in a patina, dark, and look dirty

335
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,596
And then, you cannot clean it

336
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:37,274
Brother has mentioned this before

337
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:41,564
If you choose a government job as your profession, that's fine.

338
00:25:41,664 --> 00:25:43,294
But this is a gift

339
00:25:43,502 --> 00:25:46,547
For generations, the art we received from Saraswati

340
00:25:46,647 --> 00:25:48,726
was taught to me by Father

341
00:25:48,826 --> 00:25:49,826
and taught to you by me

342
00:25:49,926 --> 00:25:51,875
and it must be you who must teaches it to the next generation

343
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:53,207
I'll focus my energies on that

344
00:25:53,307 --> 00:25:57,982
Sometimes when I hear his words and way of speaking, he truly is his father

345
00:25:58,082 --> 00:26:00,905
Grandfather, were you sleeping?
Oh, no. 

346
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:04,313
I already have one or two of these

347
00:26:04,413 --> 00:26:05,801
Well, it won't be anything like this

348
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:09,071
This is for Mother

349
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:11,995
This is for mother and son

350
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:14,953
And this is for the official

351
00:26:15,731 --> 00:26:16,925
Here

352
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:18,274
Where's Radha?

353
00:26:18,949 --> 00:26:19,949
Brother ..
Come closer, child

354
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:23,689
Do you like it?

355
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:25,471
Huh?

356
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:28,447
Didn't you buy anything for yourself?

357
00:26:29,156 --> 00:26:31,976
I got some medicine for myself.

358
00:26:32,076 --> 00:26:33,187
My stomach isn't well

359
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:37,771
Ramani, please put this inside

360
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:41,145
He's truly his father's son

361
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:45,366
He can't get any sleep if he hasn't blown all his cash on something

362
00:26:45,466 --> 00:26:47,044
What's the point in hoarding it?

363
00:26:47,144 --> 00:26:50,923
Ah Gopi, did you drop by Uncle's on your way back?
No

364
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,614
Ah, Devi's quite troubled over there

365
00:26:53,099 --> 00:26:55,261
Something about you not smiling at her

366
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:58,046
Or that you didn't take her along with you. Something like that

367
00:26:58,146 --> 00:27:00,538
And so, she didn't go to college and headed straight home

368
00:27:00,638 --> 00:27:02,043
She's not like Ramani

369
00:27:02,143 --> 00:27:03,721
She gets sulky very quickly

370
00:27:03,821 --> 00:27:05,278
And she gets over it as quickly

371
00:27:05,378 --> 00:27:07,077
He's also got some of that as well

372
00:27:07,177 --> 00:27:09,257
They're kids right? They can be allowed some laxity

373
00:27:09,357 --> 00:27:12,855
That's right
OK then, I'll just sing and dance on the road

374
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:14,602
Oh please, nothing as drastic as that!

375
00:27:17,353 --> 00:27:21,124
Now, why are we simply delaying that?

376
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:23,321
We were thinking it should be after Radha's

377
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:25,986
Who's going to come for her?

378
00:27:26,086 --> 00:27:28,390
What do you think about advertising in the newspapers again?

379
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,501
Nothing will come of that, Mother

380
00:27:30,601 --> 00:27:32,767
You know how it goes with newspaper ads

381
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:34,618
They're only interested in the number of lakhs they can get

382
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:37,231
They don't care if she has eyes, arms, legs, or noses

383
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:39,203
Well, that's how it is

384
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:42,611
Who would love a mute?

385
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:46,988
Being mute is an ailment for humans, Mother, not for goats or cows

386
00:27:47,088 --> 00:27:48,088
That's enough

387
00:27:48,188 --> 00:27:49,188
She's in the next room

388
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,921
The towel and soap is ready for your bath. Come.

389
00:28:01,692 --> 00:28:04,062
Ammai, do you think I'm a grinch?

390
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:06,208
No, I've never thought that

391
00:28:06,308 --> 00:28:08,284
I've thought he's just a killjoy

392
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:10,377
What?
What happened?

393
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:11,477
Oh, nothing!

394
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,311
Brother says I don't know how to kill time

395
00:28:16,708 --> 00:28:18,819
Before, when he used to come here, it was such a ruckus

396
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,604
Back then, Ramani studied dance

397
00:28:21,704 --> 00:28:24,511
When the two got together, it was all dancing and singing

398
00:28:24,611 --> 00:28:26,431
And Uncle would join in with the <i>mrithangam</i>

399
00:28:26,531 --> 00:28:27,531
It was so much fun

400
00:28:27,902 --> 00:28:29,562
Raman was quite different back then

401
00:28:29,662 --> 00:28:32,244
Then he'd cook up so many wacky things

402
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:34,406
I'm also getting used to some wacky things

403
00:28:38,662 --> 00:28:40,859
This much fooling around is not required
Look, Ammai, she's pinching me!

404
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:43,454
Why are you bothering him?
She's simply bugging me ... hey!

405
00:28:48,627 --> 00:28:50,235
Gopietta, let go!

406
00:28:51,758 --> 00:28:53,834
I'm a killjoy, is it?

407
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,962
Oh God, what would happen if Mother saw us?
So what?

408
00:28:56,062 --> 00:28:57,062
I have a right

409
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,162
You heard what Ammai said

410
00:28:58,262 --> 00:28:59,525
About brother and sister-in-law

411
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:03,764
Then, that means Ammai has seen stuff like this before!

412
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,243
Why is your face so red?

413
00:29:29,108 --> 00:29:30,146
What's with this girl?

414
00:29:30,246 --> 00:29:33,364
Madhavi, I'm starving, can you serve some food?
Let me iron this first

415
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:34,921
Ah, Gopi ...

416
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:39,834
Did she mention an event at her college?

417
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:42,965
Yes, she mentioned it, but it wouldn't be right if I did it.

418
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:44,747
This is also not right.
What isn't right, Uncle?

419
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,806
We want to live here without fear

420
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:48,864
Can we live like this day and night making drum noises?

421
00:29:48,964 --> 00:29:49,964
I don't understand

422
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:51,944
You don't need to understand

423
00:29:52,044 --> 00:29:53,258
I'll tell Raman

424
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,358
He'll understand quickly

425
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,494
He's also proficient in these martial arts

426
00:30:05,092 --> 00:30:08,205
Either way, we should not delay and do this as soon as possible

427
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:09,555
We're not in a hurry

428
00:30:09,655 --> 00:30:10,655
Understood, understood

429
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,378
Ramani, did you tell him?

430
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:15,212
He's taking a bath. He'll be here soon.

431
00:30:15,312 --> 00:30:16,544
Start, child

432
00:30:18,447 --> 00:30:22,097
Ramani, can you get two ounces of that medicine?

433
00:30:22,197 --> 00:30:23,793
My stomach doesn't feel good.

434
00:30:26,284 --> 00:30:27,650
Quickly, Ramani

435
00:30:39,414 --> 00:30:40,414
Brother, did you call for me?

436
00:30:40,514 --> 00:30:42,943
Ah, did you see that Ammai and Devi are here?

437
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:44,043
I saw

438
00:30:44,812 --> 00:30:49,379
Devi asked for a song and you said that wasn't possible

439
00:30:50,192 --> 00:30:52,977
It's best if you do it. What do I know about music?

440
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:55,486
Then, why did I work so hard, all these years?

441
00:30:55,866 --> 00:30:58,133
Is it enough that you set the scale and be a backup singer?

442
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:00,537
If I touch it, it'll become a devotional

443
00:31:00,637 --> 00:31:01,637
Here, take it

444
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:04,845
Let it be a <i>natthe</i>

445
00:31:16,782 --> 00:31:19,878
Since it's light music, some improvisation is alright.

446
00:36:56,601 --> 00:37:00,286
I knew he was trouble the minute I saw him

447
00:37:00,511 --> 00:37:04,127
Just because they talked, should we misunderstand what happened?
Let them talk

448
00:37:04,227 --> 00:37:06,635
Getting <i>prasadam</i>, and putting the sandalwood paste on his forehead. What's the need for all that?

449
00:37:06,735 --> 00:37:08,278
You get <i>prasadam</i> at the temple

450
00:37:08,378 --> 00:37:10,752
Do you come to the temple to talk to women?

451
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:11,852
You come to worship

452
00:37:11,952 --> 00:37:13,832
And what laughter and boyish mannerisms

453
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:16,686
If he was a young man, I'd get it but he's an old man.

454
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:08,983
Please come inside.
No need.

455
00:38:11,215 --> 00:38:12,287
What's the meaning of this?

456
00:38:12,387 --> 00:38:13,387
Of what?

457
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:14,487
Don't you know?

458
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:15,587
I saw you perform <i>kathakali</i>

459
00:38:15,687 --> 00:38:17,097
Sorry.
Sorry!?

460
00:38:17,197 --> 00:38:20,955
If you come to our neighborhood and do these filthy things, you won't leave this body

461
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:22,055
Are you threatening me?

462
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,840
No need for that

463
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,972
What's your intent behind enacting this romance?

464
00:38:26,072 --> 00:38:27,072
To deceive her?

465
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,172
Or for timepass?

466
00:38:29,691 --> 00:38:30,850
It was timepass in the beginning

467
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:33,981
until I found out she was a mute

468
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:35,712
Now, I'm serious

469
00:38:35,812 --> 00:38:39,448
I would like to marry Radha

470
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,957
with everyone's blessings

471
00:38:45,071 --> 00:38:47,320
It's been five years since my wife passed

472
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,326
I've told Radha all this

473
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:53,842
If you don't think this is a big shortcoming, I shall mail my father asking him to come here

474
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:54,942
What do you say?

475
00:39:01,142 --> 00:39:02,318
We need to think about it

476
00:39:02,418 --> 00:39:04,048
Alright, think about it

477
00:39:04,148 --> 00:39:07,076
You must let me know even if your reply isn't positive

478
00:39:07,176 --> 00:39:09,636
And if so, I will not bother you by staying here

479
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:16,522
I'm sorry, Vijayan. Sorry.

480
00:39:23,251 --> 00:39:25,379
Does he know that she is a mute?

481
00:39:25,479 --> 00:39:26,479
He knows

482
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,164
He has been here a few times

483
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:29,548
He has a nice disposition

484
00:39:29,648 --> 00:39:31,555
How many lakhs did he request?

485
00:39:32,143 --> 00:39:33,458
He didn't say anything about that

486
00:39:33,558 --> 00:39:35,517
Maybe he has entrusted all that to his relatives

487
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:37,264
He doesn't seem like that kind of person

488
00:39:37,364 --> 00:39:38,959
Then, it must be due to pity

489
00:39:40,188 --> 00:39:42,437
I fear that kind the most

490
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:45,499
Do you remember, we had someone like that once, with pity?

491
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,893
He only thought of his life after the rings were exchanged

492
00:39:50,844 --> 00:39:52,470
When the rings were removed

493
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:54,841
My child gave me a look ... O Lord.

494
00:39:57,384 --> 00:39:59,927
Do you remember then, how you cried like a dog?

495
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:05,238
Just because it happened once, does it mean it's always the case, Rama?

496
00:40:06,501 --> 00:40:08,715
Ah, we can only hope it doesn't happen

497
00:40:09,822 --> 00:40:12,556
In any case, we can ask his relatives to come, right Mother?

498
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:16,085
This will be his second wedding. That's a sad thing about this match.

499
00:40:16,185 --> 00:40:17,919
If it's a second wedding, it's a second wedding.

500
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:19,019
It'll at least be done.

501
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,382
We should ask her what she thinks

502
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:24,873
I asked. She likes him.

503
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:28,990
I'll be honest.

504
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:32,364
When he first told me about this, I did not agree

505
00:40:32,464 --> 00:40:34,284
And it's not that I'm in agreement now.

506
00:40:34,384 --> 00:40:36,170
If that's his fate, then so be it.

507
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,270
It's karma.

508
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,782
At his first weddding

509
00:40:38,882 --> 00:40:40,322
at the auspicious moment

510
00:40:40,422 --> 00:40:41,422
as we stepped out

511
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:44,975
a crow just fell and died in front of us, quivering.

512
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:46,792
It had collided with the electric cable.

513
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:48,954
Then itself, I told him that we shouldn't go ahead with the wedding

514
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:50,054
He didn't listen

515
00:40:50,154 --> 00:40:51,154
And what happened?

516
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:53,314
She died of an electric shock, just like that!

517
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:58,279
Things like horoscopes, signs, and omens; they are not lies, it's the truth. Don't you think?

518
00:40:58,379 --> 00:41:01,497
Well ... we should discuss our situation.

519
00:41:01,597 --> 00:41:05,597
Huh? What else is there to talk about? We saw the girl, and that ritual is over.

520
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:08,001
An approximate date has been decided, right?

521
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:10,112
We don't need a ritual for that

522
00:41:10,212 --> 00:41:12,240
We should consult an astrologer and settle the date.

523
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:15,682
Should we not have an idea about your expectations for gold and money?

524
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:17,828
Janardhan Nair is not such a cheapskate

525
00:41:17,928 --> 00:41:20,371
It's not like I'm waiting for your gold and cash to live my life.

526
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:23,502
You give whatever you want to your child.

527
00:41:23,602 --> 00:41:28,000
Just because we discuss some calculation for gold and cash, and we receive it from you, it doesn't make a mute, not a mute, will it?

528
00:41:29,591 --> 00:41:30,837
Father, what are you saying?

529
00:41:30,937 --> 00:41:32,411
Why are you afraid of stating facts?

530
00:41:32,999 --> 00:41:34,072
Isn't that right, Ramanathan Nair?

531
00:41:34,332 --> 00:41:35,370
That's right

532
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,255
Then, we have nothing of significance to discuss

533
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:39,677
We should consult an astrologer and fix a date tomorrow itself

534
00:41:39,777 --> 00:41:40,777
Ah, Vijaya

535
00:41:40,877 --> 00:41:42,497
Ask mother and grandmother to come here

536
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:45,386
If they go anywhere, they just take root.

537
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:47,687
I want to reach there before <i>deepaaradhanam</i>

538
00:42:11,716 --> 00:42:12,858
Today, I am relieved

539
00:42:12,958 --> 00:42:17,806
Radha's situation was such a burden for me and now it's over.

540
00:42:17,906 --> 00:42:20,712
You can't survive without this, can you Ramanettan?

541
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:25,816
Lately, this has become a daily affair

542
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:29,172
Have you decided to destroy yourself through drink?

543
00:42:29,272 --> 00:42:30,729
Oh, the tears have begun

544
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:33,600
Today's such a happy day

545
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,694
Come, and sit here

546
00:42:35,794 --> 00:42:38,704
Ah, listen to me, Ramani

547
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:40,673
Sit there

548
00:42:41,818 --> 00:42:44,672
If one has a bit of this, who told you that one would be destroyed?

549
00:42:44,772 --> 00:42:47,406
Do you know how comfortable it is to sing after having a bit of this?

550
00:42:47,506 --> 00:42:49,205
The voice really comes through

551
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:55,173
Haven't you told me several stories of people whose lives have been ruined by drink?

552
00:42:56,402 --> 00:42:57,405
And now, you!

553
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,516
Please don't cry

554
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,162
Why are you needlessly worrying me?

555
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:04,463
Music, itself, is an intoxicant

556
00:43:04,563 --> 00:43:07,318
One who has experienced that intoxicant, will not be drowned by this one

557
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,650
Moderation is key

558
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:10,380
In excess, even <i>amritham</i> is poison

559
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,629
Can you tell me, for sure, that it is not in excess?

560
00:43:12,729 --> 00:43:15,449
Oh, of course, I can say that

561
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:20,085
Earlier, after the concert, you were so drunk, you couldn't even stand straight

562
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,005
And then, a lie

563
00:43:22,105 --> 00:43:24,202
about an elephant who went wild

564
00:43:24,302 --> 00:43:25,302
Ah, so

565
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:27,922
he comes and unloads everything here, doesn't he?

566
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,825
Then, once, a mistake was made

567
00:43:29,925 --> 00:43:32,835
And so, everyone should know?

568
00:43:32,935 --> 00:43:36,866
Can you look me in the face and say that it was a mistake which was only made once?

569
00:43:36,966 --> 00:43:37,966
You ...

570
00:43:39,443 --> 00:43:40,706
Didn't you go to Panikar?

571
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:41,806
I just returned

572
00:43:43,544 --> 00:43:45,256
Brother, you haven't answered my question

573
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:48,924
Are you cross-examining me?

574
00:43:49,481 --> 00:43:50,481
Brother, you must forgive me

575
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:53,076
I must say this now

576
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:54,373
in front of sister-in-law

577
00:43:55,273 --> 00:43:57,452
I do not have to right to scold or advise.

578
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:58,552
I'm begging you

579
00:43:58,652 --> 00:44:01,846
You must stop this at least in the memory of our deceased father

580
00:44:02,798 --> 00:44:03,798
Gopi ...

581
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,310
Are you making me out to be a drunkard?

582
00:44:07,023 --> 00:44:08,282
It has ended.

583
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:10,150
Today itself, it has ended.

584
00:44:10,482 --> 00:44:12,642
So, are you content?

585
00:44:12,742 --> 00:44:14,129
Can we trust you?

586
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,603
Now, on whom do I have to swear?

587
00:44:16,703 --> 00:44:17,970
There is no need to swear on anyone.

588
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:20,582
Just hold firm

589
00:44:20,682 --> 00:44:22,087
I'm holding firm

590
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:23,835
I will not touch it henceforth

591
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,935
Enough?

592
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,561
Ah, so, how did it go?

593
00:44:29,661 --> 00:44:30,893
I asked him to look at the date

594
00:44:30,993 --> 00:44:32,969
The 30th seems to be have an auspicious hour

595
00:44:33,069 --> 00:44:34,941
After that, we'll have to wait for a month

596
00:44:35,041 --> 00:44:36,481
Then, let it be the 30th!

597
00:44:36,581 --> 00:44:39,370
Also, we told Janardhan Nair, that it would be the 30th, right?
That's right

598
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,103
Then we don't need to change it and make him uncomfortable

599
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:07,949
Where on earth is Raman?

600
00:45:08,049 --> 00:45:10,354
I saw him talking to Govindan Menon and Kurup

601
00:45:12,952 --> 00:45:13,952
Where is Kunjunni?

602
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:15,717
He went to look for him

603
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:28,397
No need.
Get lost!

604
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:31,667
Brother, what is this?

605
00:45:32,601 --> 00:45:34,435
No problem. There is no problem.

606
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,566
That Menon and Kurup got him drunk. The bastards!

607
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:40,801
Don't talk nonsense. I'm fine.

608
00:45:40,901 --> 00:45:43,863
Raman, should your uncle have to see this?
It just happened ...

609
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:45,489
There's absolutely no problem

610
00:45:55,264 --> 00:45:56,406
Switch on the mic.

611
00:45:56,596 --> 00:45:57,876
Raise it, raise the curtain!

612
00:52:49,368 --> 00:52:53,434
Is it time for them to be back from the concert?
No, it's only turning 11

613
00:52:53,534 --> 00:52:55,129
Then, who could it be at this time?

614
00:53:00,008 --> 00:53:02,447
What happened? Was the concert canceled?

615
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:12,827
Where is Father and Gopi, Ramanetta?

616
00:53:28,535 --> 00:53:29,535
What happened there?

617
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:32,445
Where is everyone, Ramanetta?

618
00:53:34,988 --> 00:53:36,943
Rama, tell us

619
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:38,915
What happened to my son?

620
00:53:39,434 --> 00:53:41,752
Nothing has happened to Mother's son

621
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:44,191
He's probably singing and bringing down the house

622
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:47,565
But ... why didn't you sing tonight?

623
00:53:47,945 --> 00:53:49,519
I don't understand what's going on

624
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:50,852
I ...

625
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:53,049
I have been defeated!

626
00:53:53,654 --> 00:53:55,246
Everyone has gotten together and defeated me

627
00:53:55,346 --> 00:53:58,879
You drank, didn't you?

628
00:54:00,609 --> 00:54:01,872
I was betrayed

629
00:54:02,754 --> 00:54:04,761
Raman was not able to keep his vow

630
00:54:12,407 --> 00:54:13,497
What is it, Rama?

631
00:54:17,424 --> 00:54:19,241
What is it that I'm hearing, Ramani?

632
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:26,662
He's the son of Ayanoor Devanarayanan Namboodri

633
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:28,167
who drinks?

634
00:54:28,267 --> 00:54:30,312
to the point that he cannot sing at a concert?

635
00:54:30,412 --> 00:54:31,714
with the audience booing him?

636
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:33,613
O Lord ...

637
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:37,924
Has God kept me here to see and hear all this?

638
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:40,139
If Father were here

639
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:41,239
he would kill him

640
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:42,339
that's what would happen

641
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:44,498
Once I stood there watching

642
00:54:44,913 --> 00:54:48,477
a person who had come to invite him to a concert get slapped across his face for coming drunk

643
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,519
There is no point in talking about old tales

644
00:54:50,916 --> 00:54:53,892
If Father were here, he would have beaten him, or scolded him, or done whatever

645
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:56,366
Apart from tearfully pleading with him, what can we do?

646
00:54:56,729 --> 00:54:58,892
Sister-in-law and I have begged him several times

647
00:54:58,992 --> 00:55:00,950
How long has this been going on?

648
00:55:01,594 --> 00:55:02,594
For a while

649
00:55:02,694 --> 00:55:04,773
This medicine he keeps drinking is nothing else.

650
00:55:05,258 --> 00:55:06,258
Oh Lord ...

651
00:55:07,576 --> 00:55:08,649
Has he awoken, Ramani?

652
00:55:08,749 --> 00:55:09,749
Yes.

653
00:55:09,849 --> 00:55:11,399
And what did he say?

654
00:55:11,499 --> 00:55:12,956
He cried a lot last night

655
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,759
And said that death is preferable.

656
00:55:20,104 --> 00:55:21,104
Go to him

657
00:55:21,204 --> 00:55:22,748
Ask your brother for forgiveness

658
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:24,045
I will ask him for forgiveness

659
00:55:24,145 --> 00:55:26,346
But first tell me what was my mistake?

660
00:55:26,446 --> 00:55:29,910
The people were heckling, and I only sang when I thought the performance would be ruined.

661
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:31,363
It wasn't to steal the limelight!

662
00:55:31,463 --> 00:55:33,457
In any case, it was his concert

663
00:55:33,557 --> 00:55:35,775
Didn't you sing without anybody's permission?

664
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:36,875
That, is a mistake.

665
00:55:36,975 --> 00:55:40,203
It's not just in art and music, it's like that for anything.

666
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:43,663
So, I shouldn't have sung even thought the audience was heckling and the performance would've been ruined, right?

667
00:55:43,763 --> 00:55:46,051
You should not have sung without your brother's permission

668
00:55:50,566 --> 00:55:51,846
In your workplace

669
00:55:52,071 --> 00:55:56,223
would you tolerate it, if your junior sat in your chair and worked?

670
00:55:58,126 --> 00:55:59,337
In a government job

671
00:55:59,437 --> 00:56:01,292
it might not be a big thing

672
00:56:01,392 --> 00:56:02,711
but in arts

673
00:56:02,811 --> 00:56:04,406
it's a very big thing

674
00:56:04,506 --> 00:56:05,963
You must respect your Guru

675
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:07,063
Don't you think?

676
00:56:11,966 --> 00:56:12,966
Brother ...

677
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:27,034
Stop ... there is no need for that.

678
00:56:35,667 --> 00:56:37,725
I heard that the concert was phenomenal

679
00:56:37,985 --> 00:56:39,161
It was not bad

680
00:56:39,542 --> 00:56:43,538
If you neglect the fact that I was not able to touch your feet and start.

681
00:56:44,783 --> 00:56:46,150
What is the meaning in all that?

682
00:56:47,084 --> 00:56:48,762
Yesterday, after the concert

683
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:52,516
the music committee honored me with a gold shawl.

684
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,578
As this is my first token of honor

685
00:56:57,049 --> 00:56:58,710
it belongs to you

686
00:56:59,402 --> 00:57:01,132
Please accept it and bless me

687
00:57:03,194 --> 00:57:06,426
Why do you need my blessings now?

688
00:57:07,048 --> 00:57:08,048
You can keep it.

689
00:57:08,148 --> 00:57:12,238
Here, in my closet, there's no room for these gold shawls.

690
00:57:12,338 --> 00:57:15,785
You are punishing me, aren't you?

691
00:57:17,134 --> 00:57:19,314
You are my guru, and my father

692
00:57:20,404 --> 00:57:22,289
if I have unknowingly committed a mistake

693
00:57:23,137 --> 00:57:24,262
I beg your forgiveness

694
00:57:25,057 --> 00:57:26,057
Forgiveness?

695
00:57:26,839 --> 00:57:28,137
You didn't do anything wrong, did you?

696
00:57:28,725 --> 00:57:30,005
When everyone told me that

697
00:57:30,663 --> 00:57:31,752
it didn't seem like it

698
00:57:32,517 --> 00:57:33,517
but

699
00:57:34,866 --> 00:57:35,922
now I believe so

700
00:57:37,686 --> 00:57:39,053
When the people were heckling

701
00:57:40,506 --> 00:57:44,450
and when I could not bear to watch your rhythm and voice quaver anymore 

702
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,388
I couldn't help but sing

703
00:57:46,488 --> 00:57:47,488
Good

704
00:57:48,568 --> 00:57:51,128
Not missing the opportunity, was definitely a good thing.

705
00:57:51,228 --> 00:57:52,443
Only they are victorious

706
00:57:52,543 --> 00:57:54,259
That's not a mistake

707
00:57:55,107 --> 00:57:58,601
In the past, during the Kurukshethra War

708
00:57:59,588 --> 00:58:01,577
after putting down his bow and arrows

709
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:04,760
pointing at Karnan whose chariot was stuck in the mud

710
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,542
Krishna said

711
00:58:06,642 --> 00:58:07,642
"There,

712
00:58:07,742 --> 00:58:08,742
this is the chance."

713
00:58:09,414 --> 00:58:13,151
Not foregoing that opportunity is Arjunan's victory

714
00:58:15,296 --> 00:58:16,420
You won

715
00:58:17,268 --> 00:58:18,268
I ...

716
00:58:25,382 --> 00:58:26,887
What can I say?

717
00:58:26,987 --> 00:58:28,790
From one point of view, you're right

718
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,831
From another point of view, it's not that right

719
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,028
Ah you're early today. Let's go?

720
00:58:33,340 --> 00:58:35,467
I heard that Kallur Gopinathan did extremely well?

721
00:58:36,575 --> 00:58:39,221
Oh, after a concert, you're so conceited?

722
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:43,183
Can't you smile a bit?
Please be quiet. Isn't there a limit to your jokes.

723
00:58:46,127 --> 00:58:47,127
What?

724
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:50,189
Uncle, tell me what I should do.

725
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:53,459
I will never sing again. Is that enough?

726
00:58:53,736 --> 00:58:55,327
What are you saying?

727
00:58:55,427 --> 00:58:57,109
A singer, who chooses to not sing again?

728
00:58:57,209 --> 00:58:58,580
Then, what is the point of that life?

729
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,206
Isn't it better to just die?

730
00:59:00,306 --> 00:59:01,815
It is a preparation for that

731
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,133
if it is atonement for the sins that I have committed.

732
00:59:04,233 --> 00:59:06,607
What an ill-fated pronouncement, Gopinatha

733
00:59:06,707 --> 00:59:08,856
What happened for you to have such thoughts?

734
00:59:09,479 --> 00:59:10,793
Tell us what happened, Gopietta

735
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,281
What happened, Father?

736
00:59:12,381 --> 00:59:13,613
I know nothing, daughter

737
00:59:13,713 --> 00:59:15,655
Something has been said between brothers

738
00:59:15,755 --> 00:59:16,987
Can you please tell us?

739
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:18,492
Instead of just worrying us?

740
00:59:20,066 --> 00:59:22,229
Brother says that when an opportunity presented itself

741
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:24,408
I deliberately defeated him.

742
00:59:24,858 --> 00:59:26,277
What can I do to him?

743
00:59:26,377 --> 00:59:27,816
Tell me in a way that I can understand

744
00:59:27,916 --> 00:59:29,443
He's talking about yesterday's concert

745
00:59:29,543 --> 00:59:30,543
Oh I see

746
00:59:30,643 --> 00:59:33,352
If Brother is drunk, and cannot sing, what should Gopiettan have done?

747
00:59:33,452 --> 00:59:34,667
Is it his fault for singing now?

748
00:59:34,767 --> 00:59:36,241
That's exactly what I said

749
00:59:36,691 --> 00:59:39,061
With all the drinking, he must have acquired the habits of drunkards

750
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,673
Unwanted thoughts, and actions

751
00:59:42,175 --> 00:59:44,545
Don't you know how that coconut tree climber, Velayithan, behaves?

752
00:59:44,645 --> 00:59:47,573
He beats up that poor Kathu in the evening after drinking

753
00:59:47,673 --> 00:59:49,562
Every day, he has a different reason

754
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:52,226
For me, it's when I think of my daughter ...

755
00:59:52,832 --> 00:59:54,060
Can you please go inside?

756
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:55,617
What an example

757
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,520
The coconut tree climber, Velayithan

758
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:01,153
Normal women at least have some sense. Well, her head is full of play sand anyway.

759
01:00:01,253 --> 01:00:02,253
If it's play sand, then it's play sand.

760
01:00:02,485 --> 01:00:04,700
Just look at what "people with sense" are doing and saying

761
01:00:07,658 --> 01:00:08,869
Don't worry about any of this

762
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:11,412
When someone who is better than you comes

763
01:00:11,965 --> 01:00:13,073
it can happen to anyone

764
01:00:13,609 --> 01:00:15,720
In that case, I'm not so amazing

765
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:17,917
You will surpass your brother and your father

766
01:00:18,017 --> 01:00:19,017
I am sure of it.

767
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:24,698
Shouldn't Brother take joy in that, Father?

768
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:25,798
He will be happy

769
01:00:25,898 --> 01:00:27,674
Raman is only capable of that

770
01:00:27,774 --> 01:00:28,774
I know it

771
01:00:28,874 --> 01:00:30,494
Go to work in peace

772
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:32,120
I made a mistake

773
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:35,026
If you keep needling me about it, will the mistake be fixed?

774
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:37,137
All I'm saying is that this shouldn't happen again

775
01:00:37,237 --> 01:00:38,237
I got it!

776
01:00:38,815 --> 01:00:40,493
Who would commit an error knowingly?

777
01:00:40,998 --> 01:00:41,998
It just happened ...

778
01:00:42,590 --> 01:00:43,590
Everyone, please forgive me

779
01:00:43,690 --> 01:00:44,939
I will fix this. Isn't that enough?

780
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:46,039
That's enough

781
01:00:46,139 --> 01:00:49,904
Humans who do not make mistakes do not exist, do they?
Similarly, Gopinathan is also very worried

782
01:00:50,004 --> 01:00:51,004
You should not hurt him

783
01:00:51,104 --> 01:00:53,087
Isn't there anyone here who sees my pain?

784
01:00:53,187 --> 01:00:54,955
Every second, I sting and burn

785
01:00:55,055 --> 01:00:56,270
I can't meet people outside

786
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:57,706
I'll have to answer people's questions

787
01:00:57,806 --> 01:00:58,806
Does he want this?

788
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,716
He didn't sing to implicate you!

789
01:01:00,816 --> 01:01:02,775
We escaped the audience because of that

790
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:03,875
I agreed with that

791
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:04,975
I have no complaints about that

792
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:06,719
He saved me, right?

793
01:01:06,819 --> 01:01:07,819
What luck

794
01:01:07,919 --> 01:01:10,456
Because of that he has only profited

795
01:01:10,854 --> 01:01:12,151
Let him grow

796
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,251
and surpass Father

797
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:16,528
Regardless, when he came to apologize ...
This is not something we need to discuss right now!

798
01:01:17,272 --> 01:01:19,486
We don't have much time till Radha's wedding

799
01:01:19,586 --> 01:01:20,586
That must be conducted beautifully

800
01:01:20,686 --> 01:01:23,448
Exactly. Everyone should come together and make it a success

801
01:01:23,548 --> 01:01:24,548
Heeranda ...

802
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:28,724
Call a carpenter to fix that spot

803
01:01:28,824 --> 01:01:31,839
We need to clean this place after fixing these broken and worn out sections

804
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:36,457
Just tell me how much paint you need, and we'll buy it today or tomorrow

805
01:01:36,557 --> 01:01:37,557
Start working as soon as possible.

806
01:01:37,657 --> 01:01:40,160
Let's not have a panic attack at the last minute

807
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,738
OK, get going

808
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:45,332
Radha, ask them to give Uncle something to drink

809
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:12,095
Are your hands aching? I'll write some.

810
01:02:41,245 --> 01:02:44,065
A loss of strength. It's because I haven't eaten.

811
01:02:48,321 --> 01:02:50,293
You've got the journalists eating out of your hand, huh?

812
01:02:50,393 --> 01:02:51,393
They're raving about you.

813
01:02:51,493 --> 01:02:52,493
I heard

814
01:02:52,593 --> 01:02:53,593
You just heard about it?

815
01:02:53,693 --> 01:02:54,693
You didn't see it?
No.

816
01:02:54,793 --> 01:02:55,793
Here.

817
01:03:05,759 --> 01:03:07,939
You didn't let me know about your first concert?

818
01:03:08,336 --> 01:03:10,430
At least your debut went well. That's enough.

819
01:03:11,278 --> 01:03:12,765
It wasn't a debut.

820
01:03:13,786 --> 01:03:14,789
It was a mistake.

821
01:03:14,889 --> 01:03:15,889
A mistake?

822
01:03:15,989 --> 01:03:16,989
Yes

823
01:03:17,834 --> 01:03:19,201
Brother was supposed to sing at that concert

824
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,834
He drinks once in a while

825
01:03:23,007 --> 01:03:24,200
I've mentioned it before

826
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:26,138
He went overboard this time

827
01:03:26,709 --> 01:03:29,875
When he sang, and it didn't work out and the people started heckling, I stepped in

828
01:03:30,913 --> 01:03:32,054
Brother was very depressed

829
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:35,930
He believes that I deliberately took advantage of the opportunity for my own gain

830
01:03:36,362 --> 01:03:37,815
Your brother is really something

831
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:39,926
It's a complex, of sorts.

832
01:03:40,445 --> 01:03:41,725
Everyone has a time

833
01:03:41,825 --> 01:03:45,254
Nobody can sit on the throne forever; eventually, they have to step down

834
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:47,088
When his time ended

835
01:03:47,188 --> 01:03:49,164
alcohol just emerged as a reason

836
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:52,243
You must not worry and throw away your future over this

837
01:03:53,229 --> 01:03:56,205
My brother is dearer to me, than my future

838
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:59,994
He chanted the first notes of music to me

839
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:05,235
He made Gopinathan, the Kalloor Gopinathan these reporters talk about

840
01:04:06,395 --> 01:04:10,131
I just want to learn under my brother's tutelage

841
01:04:22,864 --> 01:04:24,165
Stop butchering it!

842
01:04:24,265 --> 01:04:26,410
You really are inconveniencing me

843
01:04:26,794 --> 01:04:27,794
Why, are you tired?

844
01:04:28,417 --> 01:04:31,341
Do you always want to prepare cumin water and give it to everyone?

845
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:33,486
Just practice for a few days, and it will be fine

846
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:34,783
It's not about getting it right

847
01:04:34,883 --> 01:04:36,462
Then?
It weighs on my mind

848
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:38,365
Our Gopinathan ...

849
01:04:38,883 --> 01:04:41,063
What weighs on my mind doesn't bother you

850
01:04:41,163 --> 01:04:42,163
Right?

851
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,139
I'll get somebody else?

852
01:04:48,433 --> 01:04:49,609
I'll decide that!

853
01:04:49,973 --> 01:04:52,101
You just do as you're told. Understood?

854
01:04:52,966 --> 01:04:55,664
When Gopi is available, why are you needlessly bothering Kunjunni?

855
01:04:56,858 --> 01:04:58,605
Now that he has started to sing by himself

856
01:04:58,705 --> 01:05:02,498
it's not right to ask him to sing together or assist

857
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:03,743
Perhaps, he doesn't feel like it?

858
01:05:04,124 --> 01:05:06,113
Rama, are you talking about Gopi?

859
01:05:06,213 --> 01:05:07,213
Mother ...

860
01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:11,027
Even if someone is your brother or son, you must respect, whom you must respect.

861
01:05:11,127 --> 01:05:13,137
He's has a bigger name than me

862
01:05:29,295 --> 01:05:30,869
He's assisted by someone through him music does not flow through

863
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:31,969
Move aside!

864
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:33,862
Gopi, get in there

865
01:05:35,596 --> 01:05:36,596
No.

866
01:05:37,997 --> 01:05:39,537
I'm training him

867
01:05:40,297 --> 01:05:41,855
If I happen to get another concert

868
01:05:42,218 --> 01:05:43,654
I need to still fill my stomach

869
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,477
You're getting rid of me, aren't you?

870
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:48,965
You don't need to see it like that

871
01:05:49,065 --> 01:05:51,075
You'll get plenty of concerts in the future

872
01:05:51,175 --> 01:05:53,964
It's not good for you to assist me

873
01:05:54,064 --> 01:05:56,663
That's also true. You should see what's in the papers.

874
01:05:56,763 --> 01:05:57,763
Oh I forgot!

875
01:05:57,863 --> 01:05:59,483
Did you see what's printed?

876
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:00,694
What is it, brother?

877
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:01,794
Our Gopi's picture!

878
01:06:01,894 --> 01:06:03,635
The press has great things to say about him!

879
01:06:05,507 --> 01:06:06,818
Look here

880
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:10,849
Radha, look at this!

881
01:06:13,842 --> 01:06:15,330
It wasn't there in the paper we get here

882
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:16,430
It wasn't in the paper at home either

883
01:06:16,530 --> 01:06:17,530
It's only published in the <i>Mathrbhumi</i>

884
01:06:17,630 --> 01:06:19,412
I borrowed it from another house

885
01:06:21,803 --> 01:06:22,803
Look, son

886
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:24,654
Ah, I saw, I saw

887
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,215
I'll just show Father and Ramani and return.
Ah, OK.

888
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:32,820
Nowadays...

889
01:06:33,477 --> 01:06:35,449
It's not that hard to become famous

890
01:06:36,228 --> 01:06:37,819
but excessive praise

891
01:06:38,408 --> 01:06:39,843
will only stunt growth

892
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:41,867
it's good to remember that.

893
01:07:00,274 --> 01:07:01,589
Haven't you gone to bed yet?

894
01:07:03,285 --> 01:07:04,285
Do you want some coffee?

895
01:07:04,385 --> 01:07:05,385
No

896
01:07:06,139 --> 01:07:07,731
Looks like Kunjunni is sleepy

897
01:07:09,118 --> 01:07:10,118
Sister-in-law ...
Yes?

898
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,716
Kunjunni learned to assist quickly, didn't he?

899
01:07:15,394 --> 01:07:18,214
Have I committed such a grave crime to earn such contempt?

900
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,705
Do you think you made a mistake?

901
01:07:21,172 --> 01:07:22,608
Isn't that what everyone says?

902
01:07:23,404 --> 01:07:25,117
Don't include me with everyone

903
01:07:28,888 --> 01:07:31,483
Don't think that I didn't try to talk to him about you

904
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:33,386
I tried

905
01:07:34,237 --> 01:07:35,237
He should try and understand, right?

906
01:07:36,348 --> 01:07:39,666
Alcohol is capable of altering people's minds, isn't it?

907
01:07:41,448 --> 01:07:43,628
In some way, this was a blessing

908
01:07:44,752 --> 01:07:45,980
He's determined now

909
01:07:46,638 --> 01:07:48,039
to regain his reputation

910
01:07:49,717 --> 01:07:51,015
He doesn't drink at all now!

911
01:07:51,115 --> 01:07:52,416
And he practices

912
01:07:52,516 --> 01:07:54,717
Didn't he have a tremor in his voice before?

913
01:07:55,115 --> 01:07:56,291
That has lessened now

914
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:57,710
Good

915
01:07:58,592 --> 01:07:59,613
Let him despise me

916
01:07:59,713 --> 01:08:00,713
It's fine

917
01:08:01,775 --> 01:08:02,986
At the Thyagaraj festival

918
01:08:03,384 --> 01:08:05,495
I just want to see Brother sing and triumph

919
01:09:14,264 --> 01:09:15,264
Forgive me

920
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:16,364
I have seen you someplace

921
01:09:16,464 --> 01:09:17,929
I cannot remember

922
01:09:18,029 --> 01:09:20,870
I belong to the Mahalingam Coimbatore Thayagaraj Music Committee

923
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:23,361
Ah yes, I remember now. Please sit.

924
01:09:24,489 --> 01:09:25,489
Please sit here.

925
01:09:30,367 --> 01:09:33,256
I'm Sudhakharan. My home is in Palakkad.

926
01:09:33,356 --> 01:09:34,986
I had received the notice before

927
01:09:35,086 --> 01:09:37,650
This time the festival is truly a festival!

928
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,834
Ananthapoorthy, Balasubramaniam, and so many great singers are there!

929
01:09:40,934 --> 01:09:41,934
Yes, that's right

930
01:09:42,034 --> 01:09:46,196
There's a small problem in our usual program

931
01:09:46,296 --> 01:09:49,189
The people from my generation don't have a problem

932
01:09:49,289 --> 01:09:52,788
But there are a lot of young people in the committee. This young generation!

933
01:09:53,462 --> 01:09:57,822
They have a request

934
01:09:58,479 --> 01:10:03,479
They want your younger brother, Kalloor Gopinathan, in your place at the concert

935
01:10:11,472 --> 01:10:13,028
Gopinathan instead of Ramanathan?

936
01:10:13,128 --> 01:10:14,447
What nonsense are you spouting?

937
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:16,039
It was a sudden change

938
01:10:16,139 --> 01:10:17,139
Please cooperate with us

939
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,378
I must cooperate, by not singing, right?

940
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,481
That's not true, sir.

941
01:10:20,581 --> 01:10:23,339
We've heard good things about your brother.

942
01:10:23,439 --> 01:10:26,938
People say that he's even better than your Father

943
01:10:27,038 --> 01:10:29,048
He has only performed in one concert

944
01:10:29,148 --> 01:10:30,148
That's enough, right?

945
01:10:30,248 --> 01:10:31,248
I was there

946
01:10:31,348 --> 01:10:33,459
The concert went well and we saw some things as well

947
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:37,525
For seven years

948
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:38,771
you have sung every time

949
01:10:38,871 --> 01:10:40,553
The regulars will get tired of it

950
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:41,653
Besides

951
01:10:41,753 --> 01:10:43,736
You do not have to return the advance

952
01:10:43,836 --> 01:10:46,469
In our advance performance, we'll have a concert for you

953
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:48,683
Do you need to hurt me so?

954
01:10:48,925 --> 01:10:49,925
No need

955
01:10:55,603 --> 01:10:57,437
Rama, Rama ..

956
01:11:03,841 --> 01:11:06,243
Hello, sir
Hello

957
01:11:06,343 --> 01:11:07,506
What's the problem?

958
01:11:07,606 --> 01:11:08,606
The problem is ...

959
01:11:08,706 --> 01:11:10,308
The problem is nothing other than

960
01:11:10,408 --> 01:11:11,779
for the Coimbatore concert

961
01:11:11,879 --> 01:11:12,879
they just want you.

962
01:11:12,979 --> 01:11:13,979
Me?
Yes.

963
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:15,079
And, what about Brother?

964
01:11:15,179 --> 01:11:16,882
They don't want him.

965
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:19,027
Sir, that's our wish

966
01:11:19,127 --> 01:11:20,127
Please cooperate.

967
01:11:20,847 --> 01:11:21,847
No

968
01:11:22,421 --> 01:11:23,421
I will not come

969
01:11:23,521 --> 01:11:26,310
What can we say to console Raman now, O Lord?

970
01:11:32,382 --> 01:11:33,715
You know how it is

971
01:11:33,815 --> 01:11:35,341
We only want the event to succeed

972
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:40,029
We though Ramanathan sir would be happy if we invited his younger brother

973
01:11:40,807 --> 01:11:42,935
If not, we will invite someone else

974
01:11:43,035 --> 01:11:44,389
What do you say?

975
01:11:45,153 --> 01:11:46,153
No

976
01:11:47,122 --> 01:11:48,281
I will not sing

977
01:11:49,648 --> 01:11:51,101
Not just at your event

978
01:11:51,727 --> 01:11:52,727
Any event

979
01:11:52,827 --> 01:11:53,827
Gopi ...

980
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:54,927
That's right, Uncle

981
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,934
I will, once and forever more, abandon music

982
01:11:58,401 --> 01:11:59,959
I will end it by singing the <i>Mangalam</i>

983
01:12:00,478 --> 01:12:02,103
And for that, you must play for me

984
01:12:02,203 --> 01:12:04,872
Stop this. A singer who vows never to sing.

985
01:12:04,972 --> 01:12:06,671
Isn't death better than that?

986
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:07,771
Never mind, Uncle

987
01:12:07,871 --> 01:12:08,871
Brother is there

988
01:12:10,183 --> 01:12:11,549
I will wash my face and legs

989
01:12:21,151 --> 01:12:23,624
Appu is worried about you

990
01:12:33,191 --> 01:12:36,028
Rama, Gopi will end it with the <i>Mangalam</i>

991
01:12:36,128 --> 01:12:37,128
He will never sing again, apparently

992
01:12:38,243 --> 01:12:40,198
I'm the one who should end it all with the <i>Mangalam</i>

993
01:12:40,578 --> 01:12:41,997
Why does he need to do it?

994
01:12:42,097 --> 01:12:44,298
Tell him not to sing it, Rama

995
01:12:50,716 --> 01:12:52,481
Tomorrow, everyone will speak ill of you

996
01:12:52,581 --> 01:12:54,678
Your father's soul will not forgive you, Rama

997
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:01,698
Rametta ...

998
01:13:02,601 --> 01:13:04,037
Appu is our second son

999
01:13:04,137 --> 01:13:06,511
You always said that our eldest son was Gopi

1000
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,728
He has only sung what you taught him

1001
01:13:10,490 --> 01:13:12,860
He has only sat at your feet

1002
01:13:13,534 --> 01:13:18,949
Shouldn't we be happy to see him surpass even you and Father?

1003
01:13:19,049 --> 01:13:20,049
Yes

1004
01:14:07,994 --> 01:14:10,070
To end this sacrifice,

1005
01:14:10,170 --> 01:14:11,869
You do not need your brother's permission

1006
01:14:11,969 --> 01:14:13,443
Nor your Guru's permission.

1007
01:14:13,543 --> 01:14:14,543
Is that the case?

1008
01:14:22,404 --> 01:14:23,996
If you do not despise me

1009
01:14:24,096 --> 01:14:25,096
you must obey me.

1010
01:14:26,107 --> 01:14:27,197
You must sing

1011
01:14:27,681 --> 01:14:30,103
Surpassing me and Father

1012
01:14:30,203 --> 01:14:31,781
should be your goal

1013
01:14:33,182 --> 01:14:34,272
You may offer the <i>dakshina</i>

1014
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:40,583
The <i>dakshina</i.

1015
01:14:40,683 --> 01:14:41,683
is myself

1016
01:23:24,302 --> 01:23:25,358
There's a lot of <i>kasava</i>

1017
01:23:25,458 --> 01:23:26,458
There isn't any on this side

1018
01:23:27,918 --> 01:23:29,215
These are nice saris, right Mother?

1019
01:23:29,315 --> 01:23:30,315
This one is really good.

1020
01:23:30,415 --> 01:23:31,415
This is too much!

1021
01:23:31,515 --> 01:23:32,515
Let it be.

1022
01:23:32,615 --> 01:23:34,565
All of them have an old person's taste

1023
01:23:35,121 --> 01:23:36,620
None of us selected them

1024
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:37,720
It was a young person

1025
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:39,399
your Gopi
Ah, say that!

1026
01:23:39,499 --> 01:23:40,499
Then, how else can he improve?

1027
01:23:40,599 --> 01:23:41,942
I told him that I'd come with him

1028
01:23:42,042 --> 01:23:43,042
If only he listened. That Gopi!

1029
01:23:44,165 --> 01:23:45,697
Grandfather's taste is more tolerable than this

1030
01:23:45,797 --> 01:23:46,797
I think he has arrived

1031
01:23:46,897 --> 01:23:48,662
I'll teach him a lesson

1032
01:23:48,762 --> 01:23:50,346
What's the problem with this one?

1033
01:23:50,446 --> 01:23:52,030
I'm just messing with him, Mother

1034
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:54,775
If Gopi gets angry, let him get angry

1035
01:23:57,453 --> 01:23:58,498
How was the concert?

1036
01:23:58,598 --> 01:24:00,636
I didn't dishonor Father's or Brother's name

1037
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,432
It went well.
It didn't just go well, it was brilliant.

1038
01:24:03,532 --> 01:24:04,746
Didn't you see his garland and bouquet?

1039
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,110
Where's Brother?

1040
01:24:06,531 --> 01:24:07,963
He headed out to Mannarkadu yesterday

1041
01:24:08,063 --> 01:24:09,063
saying that he had to meet someone

1042
01:24:09,163 --> 01:24:10,977
He hasn't returned
Brother had come to Coimbatore

1043
01:24:11,077 --> 01:24:13,857
Really? Didn't I tell you, Ramani, that he couldn't not go?

1044
01:24:13,957 --> 01:24:14,957
He attended the concert

1045
01:24:15,057 --> 01:24:16,057
He was really happy

1046
01:24:16,603 --> 01:24:18,708
He took of this necklace of Father's and put it on me

1047
01:24:19,011 --> 01:24:20,746
I looked for him everywhere after the concert

1048
01:24:20,846 --> 01:24:22,194
I thought he'd be here by now

1049
01:24:22,294 --> 01:24:23,945
He'll be here before evening

1050
01:24:24,045 --> 01:24:26,236
What? Mother and daughter have locked up the house and are here?

1051
01:24:26,336 --> 01:24:28,173
Well, how long can we wait for someone?

1052
01:24:28,273 --> 01:24:29,806
You said you'd be back before noon

1053
01:24:29,906 --> 01:24:31,693
Never mind that, I'll drop by home and head back

1054
01:24:31,793 --> 01:24:33,428
Now, why are you going there?

1055
01:24:33,528 --> 01:24:35,028
We've brought your <i>mundu</i>, shirt and everything else

1056
01:24:35,128 --> 01:24:36,695
When there's a hundred things to do here

1057
01:24:36,795 --> 01:24:37,795
Here, you go

1058
01:24:37,895 --> 01:24:38,895
I already have one, give it to Mother

1059
01:24:38,995 --> 01:24:39,995
Take it

1060
01:24:40,095 --> 01:24:41,095
Go ahead and take it

1061
01:24:41,195 --> 01:24:43,466
Really? All this bashfulness in your old age. Just take it

1062
01:24:43,566 --> 01:24:44,566
Take it!
Oh, be still

1063
01:24:47,693 --> 01:24:49,512
We've been pushing everything, day after day

1064
01:24:49,612 --> 01:24:51,381
we're really in a tight place now

1065
01:24:51,481 --> 01:24:53,486
Father, we still have 3-4 days

1066
01:24:53,586 --> 01:24:56,720
Just because we have a list, should we buy all these vegetables and let them wither?

1067
01:24:56,820 --> 01:24:57,820
We just need to buy them the day after tomorrow

1068
01:24:57,920 --> 01:24:58,920
Will gold wither?

1069
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:00,476
Have you even bought that?

1070
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,204
We'll buy it tomorrow, Grandfather. Let's just wait for Brother

1071
01:25:03,304 --> 01:25:07,162
Kutta, this asfoetida which you've set aside might be a bit too much

1072
01:25:07,262 --> 01:25:10,766
Grandfather asked me to keep it there.
Regardless of who told you to do it, it's still your responsibility

1073
01:25:10,866 --> 01:25:11,866
Gopi ...

1074
01:25:12,434 --> 01:25:13,697
Raman still isn't back

1075
01:25:13,797 --> 01:25:15,819
He'll be back; he left to get something done, didn't he?

1076
01:25:15,919 --> 01:25:17,553
Ramani is really worried

1077
01:25:30,758 --> 01:25:32,139
Sister-in-law, why are you so nervous?

1078
01:25:33,143 --> 01:25:34,143
Brother will be here soon

1079
01:25:35,534 --> 01:25:36,534
I'm afraid

1080
01:25:36,634 --> 01:25:38,842
that he's drunkenly fallen somewhere

1081
01:25:38,942 --> 01:25:41,031
Now, it's even worse than before

1082
01:25:44,501 --> 01:25:45,713
At the concert

1083
01:25:46,589 --> 01:25:48,172
He was ... quite drunk

1084
01:25:48,272 --> 01:25:49,604
He has no control

1085
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:52,517
He has bought a closet full of bottles

1086
01:25:53,022 --> 01:25:54,286
He always wants to drink

1087
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:55,970
And I offer no resistance

1088
01:25:56,543 --> 01:25:59,001
He asked, how does it matter now, if he drinks or doesn't drink

1089
01:26:01,892 --> 01:26:02,892
Gopi ...

1090
01:26:03,246 --> 01:26:05,216
Shouldn't someone go inquire after him?

1091
01:26:07,945 --> 01:26:09,410
Where do we even start looking for him?

1092
01:26:10,084 --> 01:26:12,340
He must have come home straight from Coimbatore

1093
01:26:13,755 --> 01:26:15,372
He must have gone to Mannarkadu from there

1094
01:26:15,472 --> 01:26:17,545
Still, the time for his return has passed

1095
01:26:17,645 --> 01:26:19,666
And there are so many things which need to be done here

1096
01:26:19,766 --> 01:26:22,008
All the relatives will start to arrive tomorrow

1097
01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:24,264
In any case, Kuttan, you should go to Mannarkadu

1098
01:26:24,364 --> 01:26:25,364
I'll go

1099
01:26:25,797 --> 01:26:28,946
We'll check out places he may frequent over here

1100
01:26:29,536 --> 01:26:31,456
He must be drinking with some people

1101
01:26:31,556 --> 01:26:32,904
Apart from that, where can he go?

1102
01:26:34,104 --> 01:26:35,952
Isn't that Krishnettan?

1103
01:26:36,052 --> 01:26:37,418
This is Gopinathan

1104
01:26:37,518 --> 01:26:39,119
We're calling from Thrissur

1105
01:26:40,584 --> 01:26:41,898
Did Ramanettan drop by?

1106
01:26:42,791 --> 01:26:44,374
OK, has he dropped by since?

1107
01:26:45,704 --> 01:26:48,416
Are there any places he might have gone to in Ernakulam?

1108
01:26:49,948 --> 01:26:51,632
No, there's no other news

1109
01:26:51,732 --> 01:26:53,620
He hasn't been home in 2 days

1110
01:26:55,169 --> 01:26:56,281
Can you look into this?

1111
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,133
You're coming for the wedding, right?

1112
01:26:58,487 --> 01:26:59,649
Alright

1113
01:27:01,232 --> 01:27:02,799
He hasn't reached Ernakulam

1114
01:27:02,899 --> 01:27:04,466
If he did, he would have dropped by to visit Krishnettan

1115
01:27:13,857 --> 01:27:14,857
Oonietta?

1116
01:27:15,245 --> 01:27:16,643
Oonietta, this is Gopinathan

1117
01:27:16,862 --> 01:27:18,681
It's about Brother

1118
01:27:18,781 --> 01:27:20,567
No, please listen to me

1119
01:27:21,291 --> 01:27:23,043
OK, I wanted to discuss something else

1120
01:27:23,643 --> 01:27:24,643
Oonietta!

1121
01:27:26,799 --> 01:27:28,213
He won't let me get a word in!

1122
01:27:28,313 --> 01:27:29,313
He's got a bone to pick with us

1123
01:27:29,413 --> 01:27:31,244
because we didn't invite him personally

1124
01:27:31,344 --> 01:27:33,805
But you didn't ask him if he was there
That was obvious from what his way of talking

1125
01:27:33,905 --> 01:27:34,905
How much?
320

1126
01:27:35,005 --> 01:27:36,005
Kunjunni

1127
01:27:36,786 --> 01:27:37,914
Give him this money

1128
01:27:43,674 --> 01:27:45,308
Shouldn't we let the police know?

1129
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:46,408
What's the need for that?

1130
01:27:46,508 --> 01:27:48,491
Apart from scaring Ramani and Devu

1131
01:27:48,591 --> 01:27:50,613
When we get home, he'll already have arrived

1132
01:27:50,713 --> 01:27:53,594
Why don't we look around in Coimbatore?
Ah, that's right

1133
01:27:53,694 --> 01:27:54,694
Let's go straight to Coimbatore

1134
01:27:54,794 --> 01:27:56,322
We already searched in Coimbatore

1135
01:27:56,422 --> 01:27:58,327
If we go, who will get things ready for the wedding?

1136
01:27:58,427 --> 01:27:59,427
Don't we have to pick out the gold tomorrow?

1137
01:27:59,527 --> 01:28:00,920
It's OK if we do that after 2 days

1138
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:02,020
We just need it in time for the wedding

1139
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:04,508
Gopi, if you're not at home now, everyone will worry

1140
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,804
I'll go to Coimbatore

1141
01:28:05,904 --> 01:28:07,438
That is best.
You guys should go home.

1142
01:28:09,661 --> 01:28:11,244
If you insist, Kunjunni should go

1143
01:28:11,344 --> 01:28:13,602
Let's go via Guruvayur

1144
01:28:13,702 --> 01:28:15,371
and ask that Menon if he saw him

1145
01:28:17,874 --> 01:28:18,874
OK, let's go

1146
01:28:26,177 --> 01:28:27,177
Has Brother arrived?

1147
01:28:27,277 --> 01:28:28,277
No ...

1148
01:28:28,377 --> 01:28:30,073
He hasn't reached Mannarkadu's Gopalettan's place

1149
01:28:30,173 --> 01:28:31,539
Apparently, he received a letter saying that he would visit

1150
01:28:31,842 --> 01:28:33,526
Now, where else can we search for him?

1151
01:28:33,626 --> 01:28:35,160
I searched the entire area

1152
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:37,265
and the areas around it

1153
01:28:37,365 --> 01:28:38,562
He hadn't been to any of those places

1154
01:28:38,932 --> 01:28:40,667
Now where else can we look for him?

1155
01:28:41,055 --> 01:28:43,160
Maybe we should check at Nambeeshan from Kotak?

1156
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,608
He occasionally hangs out there

1157
01:28:44,708 --> 01:28:46,629
Would he do that without letting anyone know, especially during all the wedding preparations?

1158
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:48,162
In any case, you should go investigate

1159
01:28:48,262 --> 01:28:49,262
You have the vehicle, right?
I'll go

1160
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:55,724
Did you see sister-in-law?

1161
01:28:56,795 --> 01:28:57,795
I did

1162
01:28:57,895 --> 01:28:58,895
I told her about where you went

1163
01:28:59,395 --> 01:29:00,557
How could I not tell her?

1164
01:29:01,484 --> 01:29:04,010
Why is he making us eat coals like this?

1165
01:29:04,397 --> 01:29:05,442
Gopi ...

1166
01:29:06,941 --> 01:29:08,237
In any case, Kuttan, you should get going

1167
01:29:08,337 --> 01:29:09,337
Uncle ...

1168
01:29:09,437 --> 01:29:10,646
You should go with him

1169
01:29:25,164 --> 01:29:26,696
Did you receive any news?

1170
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:28,077
He must be in Coimbatore

1171
01:29:28,177 --> 01:29:30,401
He has a lot of friends there

1172
01:29:30,501 --> 01:29:31,900
Kunjunni, has gone there 

1173
01:29:32,406 --> 01:29:33,433
O Lord ...

1174
01:29:33,921 --> 01:29:35,370
Where do we look for him?

1175
01:29:35,470 --> 01:29:36,852
Who can we ask?

1176
01:29:40,102 --> 01:29:41,332
Don't cry, daughter

1177
01:29:41,972 --> 01:29:43,858
God won't let any harm come to him

1178
01:29:44,424 --> 01:29:45,424
Sister-in-law ...

1179
01:29:45,524 --> 01:29:47,917
Please don't needlessly cry and worry Appu as well

1180
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:49,416
Brother will come

1181
01:29:49,516 --> 01:29:50,847
It's only been 2 days since he left

1182
01:29:51,032 --> 01:29:52,531
There must have been a pressing situation

1183
01:29:52,631 --> 01:29:53,795
Otherwise, would he be so late?

1184
01:29:54,384 --> 01:29:57,416
When my insides trembled, I suspected as much

1185
01:29:57,516 --> 01:29:59,555
something misfortune was coming

1186
01:30:00,414 --> 01:30:02,435
If something happened in a foreign land

1187
01:30:02,535 --> 01:30:03,535
who would know?

1188
01:30:03,635 --> 01:30:05,247
Grandfather, can you please keep quiet?

1189
01:30:05,347 --> 01:30:06,645
What misfortune has happened here?

1190
01:30:32,413 --> 01:30:33,474
Please don't cry

1191
01:30:34,973 --> 01:30:36,287
They're just

1192
01:30:36,387 --> 01:30:38,443
trying to figure it out

1193
01:30:38,931 --> 01:30:40,497
Where would he go?

1194
01:30:40,952 --> 01:30:43,108
Everything will go beautifully

1195
01:30:44,758 --> 01:30:45,786
Tomorrow, when Brother arrives

1196
01:30:46,234 --> 01:30:47,234
we can go

1197
01:30:47,655 --> 01:30:48,885
get the gold

1198
01:30:48,985 --> 01:30:50,131
then the sandals

1199
01:30:50,231 --> 01:30:51,231
box

1200
01:30:51,630 --> 01:30:53,819
pick up all the clothes we gave for sewing

1201
01:30:53,919 --> 01:30:54,919
Right?

1202
01:30:55,019 --> 01:30:56,019
Please don't cry

1203
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:57,918
Go to sleep

1204
01:30:58,018 --> 01:30:59,091
Go

1205
01:30:59,472 --> 01:31:00,472
Go

1206
01:31:13,811 --> 01:31:15,596
There's no place in Coimbatore that I haven't searched

1207
01:31:15,916 --> 01:31:17,836
There are many who saw him at the concert

1208
01:31:17,936 --> 01:31:20,429
He's not in Coimbatore, Kota or Thrissur

1209
01:31:20,529 --> 01:31:22,013
Now, where can we look for him?

1210
01:31:22,838 --> 01:31:25,213
Could something have happened to my son, Gopi?

1211
01:31:25,718 --> 01:31:27,149
Uncle, don't say anything like that

1212
01:31:29,602 --> 01:31:30,602
What's this, Gopi?

1213
01:31:30,702 --> 01:31:31,702
Like small kids

1214
01:31:31,802 --> 01:31:33,516
We must face whatever happens

1215
01:31:34,661 --> 01:31:36,008
We should notify the police

1216
01:31:36,108 --> 01:31:37,108
Let them investigate

1217
01:31:37,423 --> 01:31:38,602
If we notify the police

1218
01:31:38,702 --> 01:31:40,572
they might want to ask Priya or mother something

1219
01:31:41,044 --> 01:31:43,453
Isn't it better to let them know beforehand?

1220
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:45,288
I can't bear to deal with any of this

1221
01:31:45,388 --> 01:31:46,388
Gopi ...

1222
01:31:46,488 --> 01:31:47,916
Why don't you talk to sister-in-law?

1223
01:31:55,242 --> 01:31:57,667
At least drink some water, Ramani

1224
01:32:04,606 --> 01:32:05,835
Why don't you tell her?

1225
01:32:07,318 --> 01:32:09,490
How can she stay alive if she doesn't eat something?

1226
01:32:10,602 --> 01:32:12,303
I'll tell her, Ammai, you should go

1227
01:32:22,172 --> 01:32:23,172
Sister-in-law ...

1228
01:32:23,272 --> 01:32:26,467
We have looked everywhere we can look

1229
01:32:26,567 --> 01:32:28,673
We have learned nothing

1230
01:32:29,363 --> 01:32:31,688
Shall we notify the police?

1231
01:32:33,254 --> 01:32:34,770
We can advertise in the newspaper

1232
01:32:37,431 --> 01:32:39,182
My son is now fatherless

1233
01:32:49,405 --> 01:32:50,405
Can you please come with me?

1234
01:32:54,132 --> 01:32:55,132
Please come

1235
01:32:55,232 --> 01:32:57,085
I want to talk to you about something

1236
01:33:11,367 --> 01:33:12,816
Gopietta, if you also start

1237
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:15,729
who will comfort Ammai, Radha, and sister-in-law?

1238
01:33:16,976 --> 01:33:18,794
We don't know what happened

1239
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:21,658
Everyone is needlessly killing him with their words

1240
01:33:23,443 --> 01:33:25,094
Please listen carefully

1241
01:33:25,279 --> 01:33:26,778
This is not the time to cry

1242
01:33:27,552 --> 01:33:28,967
We must find out the truth

1243
01:33:29,927 --> 01:33:31,359
What, what is it, tell me.

1244
01:33:33,110 --> 01:33:34,710
I saw an article in the newspaper

1245
01:33:35,771 --> 01:33:37,220
3 days ago, at night

1246
01:33:37,971 --> 01:33:38,971
in Palakkad, somebody

1247
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:41,211
was run over by a vehicle

1248
01:33:42,778 --> 01:33:44,917
The body has been held at a mortuary for 2 days

1249
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:47,072
The name and address is not known

1250
01:33:48,689 --> 01:33:50,559
When I read about the person's particulars

1251
01:33:51,384 --> 01:33:52,630
I had a suspicion

1252
01:33:55,358 --> 01:33:56,504
When I had that suspicion

1253
01:33:57,177 --> 01:33:58,306
I tore it out and kept it aside

1254
01:34:00,529 --> 01:34:02,617
Hit-and-run in Palakkad

1255
01:34:02,717 --> 01:34:05,430
The possibly 45-year old victim

1256
01:34:05,530 --> 01:34:07,165
passed away in an accident on the road

1257
01:34:07,265 --> 01:34:10,028
The vehicle which hit him drove away without stopping

1258
01:34:10,482 --> 01:34:11,482
With a dark complexion

1259
01:34:11,582 --> 01:34:12,582
and of height, 5'5"

1260
01:34:12,682 --> 01:34:15,619
in a white <i>mundu</i> and <i>jubba</i>

1261
01:34:15,719 --> 01:34:17,674
The body has been held (after the postmortem)

1262
01:34:17,774 --> 01:34:19,712
in the mortuary

1263
01:34:23,316 --> 01:34:25,135
Ah, it's today's paper and someone has torn out something

1264
01:34:27,527 --> 01:34:29,446
I haven't seen Ramanathan sir yet

1265
01:34:29,546 --> 01:34:31,232
I'm here on time

1266
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:34,179
We must get the ginger, and onion for the meal now

1267
01:34:34,279 --> 01:34:36,368
The kids will be here by the evening

1268
01:34:36,468 --> 01:34:38,137
If you can procure the goods, we can start work

1269
01:34:38,794 --> 01:34:39,871
Why are you quiet?

1270
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:41,152
Nothing, we can think about it

1271
01:34:41,252 --> 01:34:42,667
Think about it? Why?

1272
01:34:42,767 --> 01:34:43,779
Is something wrong?

1273
01:34:43,879 --> 01:34:44,879
Oh, not at all
Ah, Gopi

1274
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:46,726
Please tell your brother that I have arrived

1275
01:34:46,826 --> 01:34:48,394
I'll tell him, right after he arrives

1276
01:34:48,966 --> 01:34:50,448
I must go to a place

1277
01:34:50,548 --> 01:34:51,964
Once I'm back, we can buy everything

1278
01:34:52,064 --> 01:34:53,064
Uncle ...

1279
01:34:53,164 --> 01:34:55,366
Please open a room for them

1280
01:34:55,466 --> 01:34:56,466
Where are you off to?

1281
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:57,566
I'll tell you when I'm back

1282
01:34:57,666 --> 01:34:58,802
Is Devi going with you?
Yes.

1283
01:34:59,274 --> 01:35:00,368
Please don't go anywhere

1284
01:35:00,468 --> 01:35:01,468
I won't

1285
01:35:10,625 --> 01:35:12,579
I'll call the Palakkad SP and give him the news

1286
01:35:13,572 --> 01:35:16,570
What journalists write doesn't have to be true

1287
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:17,968
Don't worry about it

1288
01:35:19,208 --> 01:35:20,208
If it's the truth ...

1289
01:35:21,421 --> 01:35:22,869
How can I bear it?

1290
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:31,155
Devi seems to have more courage than you

1291
01:35:31,728 --> 01:35:33,177
No matter what, we must bear it

1292
01:35:34,372 --> 01:35:35,585
Are you really this soft?

1293
01:35:37,195 --> 01:35:38,195
Let's do this

1294
01:35:38,295 --> 01:35:39,678
I'll come as well

1295
01:35:40,368 --> 01:35:42,406
If he goes, it'll really be a problem

1296
01:35:49,968 --> 01:35:51,635
I'm the Calicut RDO

1297
01:35:51,735 --> 01:35:52,735
Harikumar

1298
01:35:53,926 --> 01:35:55,509
Isn't the CA here?
the CA has gone home.

1299
01:35:55,609 --> 01:35:56,609
Should I call him?
No need.

1300
01:35:56,709 --> 01:35:57,709
Please sit

1301
01:35:57,809 --> 01:35:58,809
OK

1302
01:35:58,909 --> 01:35:59,909
Sit

1303
01:36:03,890 --> 01:36:04,890
About why I'm here

1304
01:36:04,990 --> 01:36:07,736
Didn't somebody die a 2-3 days ago from a road accident?

1305
01:36:08,039 --> 01:36:10,700
I heard that his body is held at the mortuary

1306
01:36:11,374 --> 01:36:13,732
We suspect that it may belong to a relative

1307
01:36:13,832 --> 01:36:14,832
Oh, sir

1308
01:36:14,932 --> 01:36:16,123
We moved it from the mortuary this morning

1309
01:36:16,223 --> 01:36:17,841
Since nobody came to claim it

1310
01:36:17,941 --> 01:36:20,687
the DM from the hospital insisted that we remove it immediately

1311
01:36:25,605 --> 01:36:27,273
Do you have any photographs?
Yes, we do

1312
01:36:27,373 --> 01:36:29,816
We have secured the photographs and material objects

1313
01:36:29,916 --> 01:36:31,247
Please bring them.
Yes, sir

1314
01:36:43,081 --> 01:36:44,081
Gopi ...

1315
01:36:45,243 --> 01:36:47,651
In some horrible circumstance, if they do belong to him

1316
01:36:47,751 --> 01:36:48,751
you must not make a scene

1317
01:37:13,262 --> 01:37:14,262
Gopi ...

1318
01:38:14,768 --> 01:38:16,240
It was an accident, wasn't it?

1319
01:38:16,340 --> 01:38:17,340
Yes, sir

1320
01:38:17,440 --> 01:38:18,440
At night

1321
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,540
he passed away at midnight

1322
01:38:19,640 --> 01:38:20,640
A lorry hit him

1323
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:22,438
The car which was behind 

1324
01:38:22,538 --> 01:38:23,538
reported it here

1325
01:38:23,638 --> 01:38:25,385
Since the license plate wasn't illuminated

1326
01:38:25,485 --> 01:38:26,800
they were unable to note the number

1327
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:28,619
They drove off without stopping

1328
01:38:29,528 --> 01:38:30,859
The wheel ran over his head

1329
01:38:30,959 --> 01:38:32,796
It was smashed in

1330
01:38:36,854 --> 01:38:38,943
Shouldn't you arrange to inform everyone at home?

1331
01:38:39,043 --> 01:38:40,043
I must let them know

1332
01:38:40,789 --> 01:38:41,789
Sir

1333
01:38:42,557 --> 01:38:43,557
I would like to

1334
01:38:43,657 --> 01:38:45,410
take my brother's body home

1335
01:38:47,094 --> 01:38:48,559
Like a nameless corpse ...

1336
01:38:51,018 --> 01:38:53,056
If we have to retrieve the body again

1337
01:38:53,241 --> 01:38:55,364
We'll need a special order from the Collector

1338
01:38:55,464 --> 01:38:56,464
We must get it

1339
01:38:57,317 --> 01:38:59,119
I need to conduct the final rites

1340
01:38:59,568 --> 01:39:00,568
We will take care of it

1341
01:39:00,871 --> 01:39:03,010
But I doubt that we can take it back today

1342
01:39:03,110 --> 01:39:04,110
It's quite late in the day

1343
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:05,789
We will certainly take it back tomorrow

1344
01:39:05,889 --> 01:39:07,928
We will now head home

1345
01:39:08,248 --> 01:39:10,201
That is best. Go home.

1346
01:39:10,707 --> 01:39:13,031
Once you're there, just send someone over here to take care of it.

1347
01:39:13,131 --> 01:39:14,131
OK?

1348
01:39:14,231 --> 01:39:16,180
I'll take care of things here

1349
01:39:18,532 --> 01:39:19,532
Do not delay

1350
01:39:19,632 --> 01:39:20,632
Go ahead

1351
01:39:39,685 --> 01:39:40,685
Devi ...

1352
01:39:43,660 --> 01:39:44,660
How do I tell them?

1353
01:39:46,462 --> 01:39:47,742
How can we not tell them?

1354
01:39:59,649 --> 01:40:01,047
Even though he's my brother-in-law

1355
01:40:01,147 --> 01:40:02,698
I only call him "high priest"

1356
01:40:02,798 --> 01:40:06,032
Towards the end, he had an inclination towards ascetism

1357
01:40:06,132 --> 01:40:07,132
And he'd ask me

1358
01:40:07,232 --> 01:40:08,232
Hey, Parammu

1359
01:40:08,332 --> 01:40:09,535
Why don't you leave your family and children,

1360
01:40:09,635 --> 01:40:12,550
embrace music and become an ascetic?

1361
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:14,285
I can't bear to be away from my kids

1362
01:40:14,385 --> 01:40:17,249
It didn't happen to father or son, I'm happy

1363
01:40:18,068 --> 01:40:19,068
Uncle ...

1364
01:40:19,168 --> 01:40:21,140
Where on earth were you?

1365
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,430
Did you forget that a wedding is going to be conducted here?

1366
01:40:23,530 --> 01:40:25,148
Someone has been sent to look for you

1367
01:40:28,112 --> 01:40:30,251
Couldn't you have told us where you were going?

1368
01:40:43,977 --> 01:40:47,093
Oh Gopi, there isn't a place we haven't looked for you

1369
01:40:47,716 --> 01:40:49,518
What a great time you guys have chosen to roam around

1370
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:53,375
Sister-in-law ...

1371
01:40:55,767 --> 01:40:57,030
Brother ...

1372
01:40:57,130 --> 01:40:59,152
Your brother really gave us a scare

1373
01:40:59,489 --> 01:41:01,021
Nothing has happened to him

1374
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:02,121
A letter has arrived

1375
01:41:02,221 --> 01:41:03,221
It's addressed to you

1376
01:41:03,321 --> 01:41:05,148
When I saw the handwriting, I opened it.

1377
01:41:05,248 --> 01:41:06,248
Do you mind?

1378
01:41:06,348 --> 01:41:08,246
Even if you do, I don't care

1379
01:41:08,346 --> 01:41:09,346
He has assumed some things

1380
01:41:10,402 --> 01:41:11,969
God isn't so blind

1381
01:41:12,659 --> 01:41:14,309
Stop dreaming and come!

1382
01:41:29,467 --> 01:41:30,781
Here, read this and take a look

1383
01:41:31,017 --> 01:41:32,415
I need to go to the kitchen

1384
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:41,206
I don't understand anything

1385
01:41:47,549 --> 01:41:48,549
Please read it

1386
01:41:52,878 --> 01:41:53,989
Dear brother,

1387
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,791
The concert

1388
01:41:55,891 --> 01:41:56,891
was magnificent

1389
01:41:57,307 --> 01:41:58,941
You will surpass Father

1390
01:41:59,608 --> 01:42:00,608
To you,

1391
01:42:00,708 --> 01:42:02,511
an unnecessary jealousy

1392
01:42:02,611 --> 01:42:03,611
was upon me

1393
01:42:04,162 --> 01:42:05,408
To anyone who complains

1394
01:42:05,677 --> 01:42:07,025
how they feel towards victors

1395
01:42:07,125 --> 01:42:08,125
an emotion

1396
01:42:08,225 --> 01:42:09,225
In any case

1397
01:42:09,325 --> 01:42:10,949
Today, I am completely content

1398
01:42:11,454 --> 01:42:13,071
I have only one desire left

1399
01:42:13,559 --> 01:42:14,637
Together,

1400
01:42:14,737 --> 01:42:16,237
we should hold another concert

1401
01:42:16,456 --> 01:42:17,820
Today, I do not have the ability for that

1402
01:42:18,218 --> 01:42:19,218
Alcohol

1403
01:42:19,318 --> 01:42:21,307
has left me in a terrible state

1404
01:42:21,963 --> 01:42:23,462
I need deliverance from it

1405
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:26,376
By entrusting body and mind to God,

1406
01:42:26,865 --> 01:42:28,027
I'm going on a journey

1407
01:42:28,599 --> 01:42:30,839
From Kanyakumari, to the river Ganga

1408
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:32,793
Forgetting everything

1409
01:42:32,893 --> 01:42:35,555
A journey with only music as my focus

1410
01:42:36,397 --> 01:42:37,475
It's an ascetic's journey

1411
01:42:38,233 --> 01:42:40,961
I thought of starting this journey after Radha's wedding

1412
01:42:41,551 --> 01:42:43,285
But with every passing moment

1413
01:42:43,385 --> 01:42:45,205
My mind's resolve weakens

1414
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:47,327
After all, you're there ... for everything.

1415
01:42:47,984 --> 01:42:49,635
Please explain the situation to Radha

1416
01:42:50,376 --> 01:42:51,673
Her wedding was

1417
01:42:51,773 --> 01:42:53,222
my biggest dream

1418
01:42:53,913 --> 01:42:54,957
To sister-in-law,

1419
01:42:55,057 --> 01:42:56,057
you must tell everything

1420
01:42:56,157 --> 01:42:57,618
She will understand me

1421
01:42:57,718 --> 01:42:58,718
After all,

1422
01:42:58,818 --> 01:42:59,818
she's meant for me.

1423
01:43:00,475 --> 01:43:01,475
To Grandfather,

1424
01:43:01,575 --> 01:43:02,575
Mother,

1425
01:43:02,675 --> 01:43:03,675
Ammama and Appu,

1426
01:43:04,203 --> 01:43:05,652
ask them to pray for me

1427
01:43:06,302 --> 01:43:07,302
Your brother

1428
01:43:07,706 --> 01:43:09,475
will return as your old Ramettan

1429
01:43:09,738 --> 01:43:10,738
That is certain.

1430
01:43:17,710 --> 01:43:18,710
Gopietta ...

1431
01:43:20,702 --> 01:43:21,702
Gopietta ...

1432
01:43:21,802 --> 01:43:22,802
Cease this

1433
01:43:24,228 --> 01:43:26,047
Everyone is so happy now

1434
01:43:26,990 --> 01:43:28,338
We cannot destroy that

1435
01:43:29,308 --> 01:43:30,308
If not, then what?

1436
01:43:31,352 --> 01:43:32,919
We can also accept this

1437
01:43:33,794 --> 01:43:35,731
Brother has gone on a pilgrimage

1438
01:43:36,264 --> 01:43:37,264
He will return

1439
01:43:37,752 --> 01:43:38,752
Gopi!

1440
01:43:40,935 --> 01:43:42,283
Did you hear the news?

1441
01:43:42,923 --> 01:43:44,758
In any case, he's alive!

1442
01:43:44,858 --> 01:43:45,858
That's enough for me

1443
01:43:45,958 --> 01:43:47,672
At least, it was for a good thing

1444
01:43:47,925 --> 01:43:49,289
God made him do it

1445
01:43:49,879 --> 01:43:51,344
After his pilgrimage

1446
01:43:51,444 --> 01:43:52,927
after discarding his unwanted habits

1447
01:43:53,027 --> 01:43:54,027
he will return without delay

1448
01:43:54,352 --> 01:43:55,352
In the past

1449
01:43:55,452 --> 01:43:57,020
his father also had this idea

1450
01:43:57,120 --> 01:43:58,120
To become an ascetic

1451
01:43:58,220 --> 01:43:59,798
It's because I didn't allow it

1452
01:43:59,898 --> 01:44:01,887
If he had told me, I wouldn't have allowed it either

1453
01:44:03,369 --> 01:44:04,783
After having considered him lost

1454
01:44:04,883 --> 01:44:07,024
the joy of knowing that you haven't lost anything

1455
01:44:07,124 --> 01:44:09,145
that is truly happiness, you know

1456
01:44:13,811 --> 01:44:15,175
Why do you look so off?

1457
01:44:15,562 --> 01:44:19,301
Probably because his brother left the responsibilities of the house to him. Let him learn

1458
01:44:19,401 --> 01:44:21,878
He was just loafing about till now

1459
01:44:23,529 --> 01:44:26,560
He had planned to have a blast without any accountability forever

1460
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:27,660
Now

1461
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:30,131
He must conduct the wedding as the head of the family

1462
01:44:30,231 --> 01:44:31,697
Sister-in-law's, Appu's

1463
01:44:31,797 --> 01:44:32,797
Grandfather's

1464
01:44:32,897 --> 01:44:35,048
and Ammai's affairs need to be taken care of

1465
01:44:35,148 --> 01:44:37,474
And then this poor soul's

1466
01:44:37,574 --> 01:44:38,804
You guys are joking around here?

1467
01:44:38,904 --> 01:44:40,556
Things need to move quickly now

1468
01:44:40,656 --> 01:44:42,089
Have you given those men any water?

1469
01:44:42,189 --> 01:44:43,874
I had given them some water before

1470
01:44:43,974 --> 01:44:45,625
Not that, Mother, alcohol ...

1471
01:44:45,928 --> 01:44:47,916
Do you call that water as well?

1472
01:44:48,016 --> 01:44:50,661
Be it water, or buttermilk, it is normal to give it to them

1473
01:44:50,761 --> 01:44:53,894
Brother's closet has 3-4 bottles in it

1474
01:44:53,994 --> 01:44:55,343
Here, give it to them

1475
01:45:21,633 --> 01:45:23,334
Gopietta, Appu.

1476
01:45:26,164 --> 01:45:28,875
Uncle, why did Father abandon me?

1477
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:31,520
Let your Father be

1478
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:34,180
I'm here for you

1479
01:45:35,528 --> 01:45:36,808
Whatever you want

1480
01:45:36,908 --> 01:45:38,711
Just tell me

1481
01:45:38,811 --> 01:45:40,782
I've explained it but he doesn't understand, Gopi

1482
01:45:40,882 --> 01:45:45,144
Appu, Father will return quickly to see us

1483
01:45:45,244 --> 01:45:46,244
Isn't that right, Gopi?

1484
01:45:46,344 --> 01:45:47,344
That's right.
Come.

1485
01:45:47,444 --> 01:45:48,444
I'll get you some food

1486
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,894
Ah, Gopi

1487
01:45:49,994 --> 01:45:52,757
Brother has kept some cash there

1488
01:45:52,857 --> 01:45:53,857
At least, we should get the gold by tomorrow

1489
01:45:53,957 --> 01:45:55,334
Isn't the wedding on the day after tomorrow?

1490
01:45:55,434 --> 01:45:57,995
It won't do for you to just stand there
Come

1491
01:46:01,313 --> 01:46:03,418
In between heaven and hell,

1492
01:46:03,518 --> 01:46:05,085
I seemed to have found myself, O Lord

1493
01:46:06,904 --> 01:46:08,689
What all acts I need to put on

1494
01:46:08,789 --> 01:46:10,340
Then let's call everyone, and tell them

1495
01:46:10,828 --> 01:46:12,698
That Brother was run over, and crushed by a vehicle to his death

1496
01:46:14,214 --> 01:46:15,214
Gopietta ...

1497
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:17,885
Radha's wedding must go on

1498
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:20,816
If it does not happen at the auspicious time

1499
01:46:21,540 --> 01:46:23,309
You know his father's behavior

1500
01:46:24,201 --> 01:46:25,734
Do you think there's a chance for this to work out again?

1501
01:46:26,997 --> 01:46:28,260
If this does not happen

1502
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:30,062
How will Radha bear this?

1503
01:46:30,162 --> 01:46:32,100
How do <b>I</b> bear this?

1504
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:33,200
You must

1505
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:34,963
For your brother

1506
01:46:35,063 --> 01:46:37,371
Wasn't it his biggest dream?

1507
01:46:37,471 --> 01:46:38,955
Radha's wedding?

1508
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:40,706
It must happen

1509
01:46:41,245 --> 01:46:42,828
Thinking of our predicament

1510
01:46:42,928 --> 01:46:44,899
Brother's soul must be crying

1511
01:46:49,818 --> 01:46:50,828
Look

1512
01:46:50,928 --> 01:46:51,928
Isn't this great?

1513
01:46:52,028 --> 01:46:54,196
Isn't this nice, Mother?

1514
01:47:11,813 --> 01:47:12,874
Gopietta ...

1515
01:47:13,497 --> 01:47:15,400
Shouldn't we tell Harikumar sir the news?

1516
01:47:15,500 --> 01:47:16,500
We must

1517
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:18,095
Now, when can we do that?

1518
01:47:20,133 --> 01:47:21,133
In the evening

1519
01:47:21,233 --> 01:47:22,233
he will be here with the body

1520
01:47:23,013 --> 01:47:24,529
How do I let him know?

1521
01:47:25,354 --> 01:47:26,921
What reason can I give to leave?

1522
01:47:27,308 --> 01:47:29,531
I'll think of something and tell them

1523
01:47:29,631 --> 01:47:30,631
You must leave now

1524
01:47:31,181 --> 01:47:32,343
Otherwise it will become a huge problem

1525
01:47:35,223 --> 01:47:37,160
Give this money to Ammama

1526
01:47:39,501 --> 01:47:40,832
I'll get it home

1527
01:48:01,598 --> 01:48:02,598
Sir

1528
01:48:02,698 --> 01:48:06,364
We have it. It's packed with medicine since it has decomposed a bit.

1529
01:48:10,187 --> 01:48:12,461
The situation is in a weird state, sir

1530
01:48:12,561 --> 01:48:13,561
What happened?

1531
01:48:13,661 --> 01:48:16,334
Everyone is thrilled at home

1532
01:48:16,434 --> 01:48:18,120
A letter from brother arrived

1533
01:48:18,220 --> 01:48:19,669
A letter he wrote before his death

1534
01:48:23,004 --> 01:48:25,143
In the letter, he says that he's going for a pilgrimage

1535
01:48:26,473 --> 01:48:28,360
Everyone at home is thrilled after reading that

1536
01:48:29,168 --> 01:48:30,515
My sister's wedding is tomorrow

1537
01:48:31,408 --> 01:48:33,159
It was my brother's biggest dream

1538
01:48:33,259 --> 01:48:34,692
I could not bring myself to tell them

1539
01:48:34,792 --> 01:48:35,792
Good

1540
01:48:35,892 --> 01:48:38,751
It's best if it stays that way

1541
01:48:38,851 --> 01:48:40,351
Let the planned wedding happen

1542
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:43,265
The dead have escaped their burdens

1543
01:48:44,191 --> 01:48:46,886
It is well that you thought about the living

1544
01:48:48,452 --> 01:48:50,153
Now, brother's body

1545
01:48:50,253 --> 01:48:51,652
cannot be taken home

1546
01:48:51,752 --> 01:48:53,286
That is a problem

1547
01:48:53,993 --> 01:48:55,256
It has already been packed

1548
01:48:55,356 --> 01:48:56,671
How can we refuse them now?

1549
01:48:56,771 --> 01:48:58,271
It's not that we don't want it. We do.

1550
01:48:58,928 --> 01:49:00,696
All his final rites must be conducted

1551
01:49:01,909 --> 01:49:03,610
Everything must be done correctly

1552
01:49:03,710 --> 01:49:05,143
And nobody must know

1553
01:49:09,606 --> 01:49:12,367
Why don't we cremate him near the Bharatha stream?

1554
01:49:12,467 --> 01:49:14,574
That's exactly what I had in mind

1555
01:49:15,837 --> 01:49:18,953
He really loved the Bharatha stream

1556
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:46,540
Stir it well

1557
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,348
Everything is OK, right?

1558
01:50:35,247 --> 01:50:36,257
How did it go?

1559
01:50:36,357 --> 01:50:37,357
We cremated it

1560
01:50:37,457 --> 01:50:38,457
Where?

1561
01:50:38,557 --> 01:50:39,557
At the Bharatha stream

1562
01:50:48,872 --> 01:50:49,983
Gopietta ...

1563
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:51,550
Do not falter

1564
01:50:55,592 --> 01:50:58,118
I told everyone that you went to Guruvayur

1565
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:02,649
Gopi!

1566
01:51:04,013 --> 01:51:05,343
Where were you?

1567
01:51:05,443 --> 01:51:07,718
I was on an important ...
So, what's going on?

1568
01:51:07,818 --> 01:51:09,385
Cheriyamma, Anu, Mini and Devan have all come

1569
01:51:09,485 --> 01:51:10,766
Ah, we're happy

1570
01:51:10,866 --> 01:51:12,922
Hey, isn't there any of that?
Ah, no

1571
01:51:13,073 --> 01:51:14,876
It's a wedding, there should be some of that!

1572
01:51:14,976 --> 01:51:16,964
If Ramanathan were here, it wouldn't have been a problem at all

1573
01:51:18,126 --> 01:51:20,265
Is it true that he's an ascetic now?

1574
01:51:20,365 --> 01:51:22,337
Or is it because there was a falling out between the two of you?

1575
01:51:23,651 --> 01:51:24,998
Uncle, please leave us alone

1576
01:51:25,098 --> 01:51:26,463
You and your jealousy

1577
01:51:26,563 --> 01:51:28,248
Won't you leave us in peace?

1578
01:51:28,348 --> 01:51:29,348
Come, Gopietta

1579
01:51:30,707 --> 01:51:32,863
Hmmm, you're truly your mother's daughter

1580
01:51:36,265 --> 01:51:37,478
Come, come

1581
01:51:39,280 --> 01:51:42,362
You're really something else; couldn't you have told us before leaving?

1582
01:51:42,462 --> 01:51:43,462
Where did you duck out to?

1583
01:51:43,562 --> 01:51:45,680
I went to Guruvayur

1584
01:51:45,780 --> 01:51:47,583
Don't you know that your brother isn't here?

1585
01:51:47,683 --> 01:51:49,048
Shouldn't you be here?

1586
01:51:49,148 --> 01:51:51,507
Everyone who arrives asks me

1587
01:51:51,607 --> 01:51:53,124
What would Radha think?

1588
01:51:53,224 --> 01:51:55,330
Should she feel the lack of her elder brother's presence?

1589
01:51:57,637 --> 01:51:59,103
What's up with you?

1590
01:51:59,203 --> 01:52:01,579
You have the funny face of a monkey who ate some ginger

1591
01:52:02,724 --> 01:52:04,324
Oh, you're just imagining things

1592
01:52:04,424 --> 01:52:08,803
Be that as it may, if you call him a monkey, you'll have to deal with me!

1593
01:52:08,903 --> 01:52:10,471
Sure, sure

1594
01:52:11,330 --> 01:52:12,694
What is this Gopi?

1595
01:52:12,794 --> 01:52:14,092
This is a house of great singers

1596
01:52:14,192 --> 01:52:15,507
Forget a concert, there isn't even any singing

1597
01:52:15,607 --> 01:52:16,607
Come, we should celebrate

1598
01:52:16,707 --> 01:52:17,707
I'm not feeling well

1599
01:52:17,999 --> 01:52:19,700
If his brother were here, you'd see

1600
01:52:20,273 --> 01:52:21,789
there'd have been music and celebration

1601
01:52:21,889 --> 01:52:24,163
this is like a house mourning someone's death

1602
01:52:25,252 --> 01:52:26,252
Come

1603
01:52:26,352 --> 01:52:27,352
We'll get you feeling better

1604
01:52:27,452 --> 01:52:28,452
Otherwise, Radha will feel bad

1605
01:52:28,552 --> 01:52:29,805
Ramani!

1606
01:52:29,905 --> 01:52:30,905
I'm coming!

1607
01:52:31,005 --> 01:52:32,449
Devi ...

1608
01:52:33,865 --> 01:52:36,071
The fires that we lit have not even died

1609
01:52:37,115 --> 01:52:38,816
How can I sing before that happens?

1610
01:52:38,916 --> 01:52:40,012
I can't take it anymore

1611
01:52:40,112 --> 01:52:43,144
My chest and neck are so tight it hurts

1612
01:52:43,244 --> 01:52:44,576
Gopi!

1613
01:52:44,795 --> 01:52:46,243
They're looking for you over there

1614
01:52:46,343 --> 01:52:48,264
Why is this girl hanging around him?

1615
01:52:48,364 --> 01:52:51,212
In case someone kidnaps him!

1616
01:52:54,748 --> 01:52:55,793
You must keep it together

1617
01:52:56,871 --> 01:52:58,336
If you slip

1618
01:52:58,875 --> 01:53:00,138
You will not be able to hold on

1619
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:01,238
I cannot

1620
01:53:01,338 --> 01:53:02,338
I'm faltering

1621
01:53:02,438 --> 01:53:04,668
Pray to your brother for strength

1622
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:05,768
Gopi!

1623
01:58:29,913 --> 01:58:30,913
Is that all?

1624
01:58:31,149 --> 01:58:32,816
There's nothing left?
No.

1625
01:58:32,916 --> 01:58:33,916
Ah, then get going

1626
01:58:34,770 --> 01:58:36,690
And like that, it ended brilliantly

1627
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:38,357
Don't we have to go soon?

1628
01:58:38,457 --> 01:58:40,917
It's been a week since we locked up the house

1629
01:58:41,017 --> 01:58:43,191
Sure, we'll go tomorrow. After all, Raman isn't here.

1630
01:58:45,246 --> 01:58:46,745
I share Devi's opinion

1631
01:58:46,845 --> 01:58:48,142
You concealed it till now

1632
01:58:48,242 --> 01:58:49,540
Leave it as it is

1633
01:58:49,640 --> 01:58:51,864
For how long must I bear this burden?

1634
01:58:53,347 --> 01:58:57,119
You must try to understand my situation where I cannot even break down and cry

1635
01:58:57,219 --> 01:58:58,383
It's not that I do not understand

1636
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:00,690
Your sister-in-law

1637
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:02,761
Isn't this a shock she cannot handle?

1638
01:59:02,861 --> 01:59:05,607
And we won't have answers to any of their questions

1639
01:59:05,707 --> 01:59:07,174
Many will blame you

1640
01:59:07,274 --> 01:59:09,936
Perhaps, cruel accusations will be made

1641
01:59:10,036 --> 01:59:11,036
What accusations?

1642
01:59:11,136 --> 01:59:12,631
People won't even hesitate to say that you murdered him

1643
01:59:12,731 --> 01:59:15,258
Murder?
I only said that it's possible

1644
01:59:15,358 --> 01:59:18,273
Many will be suspicious because you concealed his death

1645
01:59:18,373 --> 01:59:19,519
That's the time we live in

1646
01:59:21,035 --> 01:59:22,786
Anyone who knows Gopiettan

1647
01:59:22,886 --> 01:59:24,235
wouldn't say that, sir.

1648
01:59:24,335 --> 01:59:26,037
It's not that they will, they might

1649
01:59:26,137 --> 01:59:27,721
I was just thinking outside the box

1650
01:59:27,821 --> 01:59:29,170
Even if they make such a mistake

1651
01:59:29,270 --> 01:59:30,483
the police have records

1652
01:59:30,583 --> 01:59:32,100
People will say that they were fabricated

1653
01:59:32,200 --> 01:59:35,165
Furthermore, my involvement, will strengthen that accusation

1654
01:59:35,265 --> 01:59:38,752
Right now, everyone at home is relieved

1655
01:59:38,852 --> 01:59:40,521
Let it be that way; that is best.

1656
01:59:42,744 --> 01:59:43,991
That's how it should be, Gopietta

1657
01:59:44,641 --> 01:59:45,641
Brother is gone

1658
01:59:45,741 --> 01:59:46,741
Now

1659
01:59:46,841 --> 01:59:47,841
what's the point in knowing?

1660
01:59:47,941 --> 01:59:49,396
what's the point in not knowing?

1661
01:59:51,434 --> 01:59:53,489
In any case, the rituals have to be conducted

1662
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:55,965
Appu must

1663
01:59:56,065 --> 01:59:57,065
conduct the ritual

1664
01:59:57,565 --> 02:00:00,108
Otherwise, Brother's soul will not attain salvation

1665
02:00:00,208 --> 02:00:01,961
Isn't all that just a belief?

1666
02:00:02,061 --> 02:00:03,224
It may be that

1667
02:00:04,150 --> 02:00:05,834
But I must get it done

1668
02:00:07,283 --> 02:00:08,529
Like an orphaned ghost

1669
02:00:09,203 --> 02:00:10,735
my brother's body

1670
02:00:11,241 --> 02:00:12,268
alone

1671
02:00:13,733 --> 02:00:14,895
was put to rest without anyone knowing

1672
02:00:16,175 --> 02:00:17,708
His soul must not also be orphaned

1673
02:00:18,617 --> 02:00:20,571
It must not founder searching for rice and lemons

1674
02:00:21,430 --> 02:00:22,912
What will you tell Appu if he asks?

1675
02:00:23,249 --> 02:00:24,680
I'll have to tell him some lie

1676
02:00:25,876 --> 02:00:28,150
Till now, wasn't I telling and enacting lies?

1677
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:31,956
I will get this done through some lies as well

1678
02:01:40,951 --> 02:01:41,951
What happened, Appu?

1679
02:01:42,051 --> 02:01:44,730
Uncle, you lied to me

1680
02:01:46,650 --> 02:01:48,620
Whose final rituals did you make me do?

1681
02:01:48,720 --> 02:01:49,720
Grandfather's

1682
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:55,526
Why did he say that it was for my father?

1683
02:01:56,166 --> 02:01:57,884
He also said my father's name

1684
02:01:57,984 --> 02:01:59,315
Ramanathan

1685
02:01:59,415 --> 02:02:00,915
Ramanathan

1686
02:02:03,004 --> 02:02:04,385
My father is dead, isn't he?

1687
02:02:04,485 --> 02:02:06,153
No

1688
02:02:06,253 --> 02:02:07,253
Lies!

1689
02:02:07,353 --> 02:02:08,898
How did he die?

1690
02:02:09,201 --> 02:02:10,498
Who killed him?

1691
02:02:10,598 --> 02:02:11,598
Who?
Appu!

1692
02:02:11,698 --> 02:02:13,159
He was not murdered

1693
02:02:13,259 --> 02:02:14,259
Just listen to me

1694
02:02:14,359 --> 02:02:15,770
Don't say anything

1695
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:17,521
I don't want to hear anything. It's all lies
Appu!

1696
02:02:17,621 --> 02:02:20,031
All you say are lies.
Appu, get back here!

1697
02:02:21,018 --> 02:02:22,018
Appu!

1698
02:02:51,542 --> 02:02:53,866
Is Appu telling the truth, Devi?

1699
02:02:55,146 --> 02:02:56,359
Mother ...

1700
02:02:56,459 --> 02:02:58,430
It's true that Brother died

1701
02:02:58,530 --> 02:03:01,411
but it was only an accident!

1702
02:03:02,001 --> 02:03:03,870
Then, why did you conceal it?

1703
02:03:04,443 --> 02:03:05,773
I told you

1704
02:03:07,121 --> 02:03:10,304
I cannot believe anything you say

1705
02:03:10,404 --> 02:03:11,404
O Lord ...

1706
02:03:18,617 --> 02:03:19,752
Devi ...

1707
02:03:21,565 --> 02:03:22,565
Appu?

1708
02:03:23,255 --> 02:03:27,129
You have made him fatherless, haven't you?
Mother, don't speak like that

1709
02:03:28,409 --> 02:03:29,409
Gopietta ...

1710
02:03:29,509 --> 02:03:32,299
Nobody understands us

1711
02:03:32,399 --> 02:03:33,399
Sister-in-law?

1712
02:03:33,499 --> 02:03:35,314
I told her everything that happened

1713
02:03:35,820 --> 02:03:36,830
But ...

1714
02:03:37,824 --> 02:03:39,929
How will my daughter ever know peace?

1715
02:03:41,411 --> 02:03:44,021
If she curses you in this pained state of mind

1716
02:03:44,121 --> 02:03:46,144
You will not remain living

1717
02:03:46,244 --> 02:03:50,136
I am prepared to receive any curse

1718
02:03:50,236 --> 02:03:51,668
Gopietta, please don't meet anyone now

1719
02:03:51,768 --> 02:03:53,082
I must

1720
02:03:53,773 --> 02:03:55,272
I cannot hide and run anymore

1721
02:03:55,963 --> 02:03:57,478
I cannot act anymore

1722
02:04:07,179 --> 02:04:10,867
How could you betray us like this, son

1723
02:04:10,967 --> 02:04:11,967
Grandfather!

1724
02:04:12,067 --> 02:04:13,067
I ...

1725
02:04:13,167 --> 02:04:14,724
No

1726
02:04:14,824 --> 02:04:15,824
I don't want to hear it

1727
02:04:15,924 --> 02:04:17,470
I don't want to hear anything

1728
02:04:18,328 --> 02:04:21,714
Didn't you step over his body to conduct this wedding?

1729
02:04:22,690 --> 02:04:25,436
If you had said one word, would I have stood by this?

1730
02:04:26,379 --> 02:04:28,332
When my Raman is lying dead

1731
02:04:28,613 --> 02:04:29,613
O Lord ...

1732
02:04:30,539 --> 02:04:32,341
What all did you make us do?

1733
02:04:46,539 --> 02:04:50,244
You didn't even show my son's body to me!

1734
02:04:50,344 --> 02:04:55,347
Didn't you bury him like an orphan, like someone with nobody?

1735
02:04:55,447 --> 02:04:57,199
How can I bear this?

1736
02:04:57,299 --> 02:05:01,444
Tell me, how can I bear this?

1737
02:05:01,544 --> 02:05:02,544
Mother

1738
02:05:04,250 --> 02:05:05,637
No!

1739
02:05:05,737 --> 02:05:07,052
I don't want to hear anything!

1740
02:05:07,152 --> 02:05:08,770
I don't want to hear anything!

1741
02:05:08,870 --> 02:05:09,870
Mother ...

1742
02:05:09,970 --> 02:05:11,448
Get out of my sight!

1743
02:05:54,827 --> 02:05:55,827
Sister-in-law ...

1744
02:05:59,683 --> 02:06:01,131
Now, for your condemnation

1745
02:06:03,153 --> 02:06:04,988
I have the strength to bear it

1746
02:06:06,582 --> 02:06:07,582
You can curse me

1747
02:06:08,744 --> 02:06:10,058
I will take on any sin

1748
02:06:20,129 --> 02:06:21,308
Are you not satisfied?

1749
02:06:22,504 --> 02:06:24,053
Now, what disguise do you want me to put on?

1750
02:06:25,350 --> 02:06:26,614
How do you want me to act?

1751
02:06:28,113 --> 02:06:29,392
Even when I was in the throes of pain

1752
02:06:29,492 --> 02:06:30,891
I didn't cry

1753
02:06:30,991 --> 02:06:32,222
I laughed

1754
02:06:33,636 --> 02:06:36,180
I sang holding back endless grief

1755
02:06:37,578 --> 02:06:38,942
I did everything he wanted

1756
02:06:40,811 --> 02:06:42,142
Radha was married

1757
02:06:52,685 --> 02:06:53,685
Sister-in-law ...

1758
02:06:56,407 --> 02:06:57,552
Whatever I did was wrong

1759
02:06:59,365 --> 02:07:00,365
it was cruel

1760
02:07:01,712 --> 02:07:03,716
What penance should I perform?

1761
02:07:04,996 --> 02:07:06,529
What fire should I be consumed by?

1762
02:07:12,339 --> 02:07:13,636
I know you better

1763
02:07:16,061 --> 02:07:17,307
than anyone else

1764
02:07:32,044 --> 02:07:33,055
At least now

1765
02:07:33,981 --> 02:07:36,271
as you have wanted to, can you not burst into tears?
