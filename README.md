# The Bharatham Subtitle Project

[Bharatham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatham) is a 1991 award winning [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam) film classic. Despite it winning several awards and widely considered as one of the best Indian movies made to date, subtitles are hard to come by.

Thefore, I decided to fix this by creating my own. Please note that I am not an expert practitioner of Malayalam and the objective of creating a GitHub project was to encourage more qualified practitioners to improve on my subtitles. 

The video file was obtained from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UisSHGY1emA).
